	  <head>Notice to Balloters</head>
	  <p>
		No substantive changes have been made to the specification since it was last balloted at HL7 in September 2009 however, where appropriate,
		ballot reconciliation suggestions have been applied to the final ISO document. This specification is being re-balloted due to the large time gap 
		between the last public review and now. Balloters are not being asked to provide detailed ballot comments as the referenced specification is already 
		a declared ISO standard, but rather to provide an "Up/Down" ballot vote on this specification for the HL7 context. Any comments provided may receive 
		future consideration.

      <head>ISO 21090 Healthcare Datatypes</head>
      	<p>
      		The ISO-Harmonized data types are effectively the XML ITS Data Types R2. They will replace the 
      		XML ITS Data Types R1. The format differences between the specification provided here and conventional HL7 specifications
			arise because of the need to align with ISO style requirements.
      	</p>
		<p>
			The ISO-Harmonized data types document is a shared document between HL7 and ISO. The final format of 
			this document is as a full ISO specification (it is identified as ISO/FDIS 21090:2009(E)). This
			document is the result of a jointly-balloted document by HL7, ISO, and CEN in a ballot that opened 
			on Mar 29, 2008 and closed on Aug 29, 2008 (5 months, per ISO and CEN rules). Ballot Disposition was 
			conducted at both HL7 and ISO meetings through 2008 and 2009.

      		The linked ISO-Harmonized Data Types, Release 1 document is a pdf: 
      		<loc href="ISO 21090 Healthcare Datatypes.pdf">ISO Datatypes Standard.pdf</loc> (for HL7 
			Normative Ballot) (Hint: right-click and select 'Save Target As' to download, or 'Open in New Window'.)  
		</p>
      	<p>Because the material would become an ISO standard, the ITS Work Group petitioned the Technical Steering Committee to move the document from DSTU to full Normative ballot and that petition was granted.</p>
      	<p>Please note that the reconciliation spreadsheet from the September 2009 ballot has been posted on the Ballot Desktop.</p>
