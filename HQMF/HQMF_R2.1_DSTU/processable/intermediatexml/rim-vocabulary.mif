							<b>Description: </b>Code specifying the level within a hierarchical Act composition structure and the kind of contextual information attached to composite Acts ("containers") and propagated to component Acts within those containers. The levelCode signifies the position within such a containment hierarchy and the applicable constraints.</p>
						<p>
							<i>Examples:</i> The "extract level" and the "folder level" must contain data about a single individual, whereas the "multiple subject level" may contain data about multiple individuals. While "extract" can originate from multiple sources, a "folder" should originate from a single source. The "composition" level usually has a single author.</p>
						<p>
							<i>Constraints:</i> The constraints applicable to a particular level may include differing requirements for participations (e.g. patient, source organization, author or other signatory), relationships to or inclusion of other Acts, documents or use of templates. The constraints pertaining to a level may also specify the permissible levels that may be contained as components of that level. Several nested levels with the same levelCode may be permitted, prohibited (or limited). Instance of the next subordinate level are usually permitted within any level but some levels may be omitted from a model and it may be permissible to skip several layers.</p>
						<p>
							<i>Discussion:</i> The levelCode concepts have been defined to meet specific health record transfer requirements. While these concepts are known to be applicable to some other types of transactions, they are not intended to a be a complete closed list. Options exist for other sets of orthogonal levels where required to meet a business purpose (e.g. a multiple patient communication may be subdivided by a super-ordinate level of subject areas).</p>

		<annotations>
			<documentation>
				<definition>
					<text>
						<p>A code distinguishing whether an Act is conceived of as a factual statement or in some other manner as a command, possibility, goal, etc.</p>
						<p>
							<i>Constraints:</i> An Act-instance must have one and only one moodCode value.</p>
						<p>The moodCode of a single Act-instance never changes. Mood is not state.</p>
						<p>To describe the progression of a business activity from defined to planned to executed, etc. one must instantiate different Act-instances in the different moods and link them using ActRelationship of general type "sequel". (See ActRelationship.type.)</p>
						<p>
							<i>Discussion:</i> The Act.moodCode includes the following notions: (1) event, i.e., factual description of an actions that occurred; (2) definition of possible actions and action plans (the master file layer); (3) intent, i.e., an action plan instantiated for a patient as a care plan or order; (4) goal, i.e., an desired outcome attached to patient problems and plans; and (5) criterion, i.e., a predicate used as</p>
						<p>The Act.moodCode modifies the meaning of the Act class in a controlled way, just as in natural language, grammatical form of a verb modify the meaning of a sentence in defined ways.  For example, if the mood is factual (event,) then the entire act object represents a known fact. If the mood expresses a plan (intent,) the entire act object represents the expectation of what should be done.  The mood does not change the meaning of individual act properties in peculiar ways.</p>
						<p>Since the mood code is a determining factor for the meaning of an entire Act object, the mood must always be known.  This means, whenever an act object is instantiated, the mood attribute must be assigned to a valid code, and the mood assignment can not change throughout the lifetime of an act object.</p>
						<p>As the meaning of an act object is factored in the mood code, the mood code affects the interpretation of the entire Act object and with it every property (attributes and associations.)  Note that the mood code affects the interpretation of the act object, and the meaning of the act object in turn determines the meaning of the attributes.  However, the mood code does not arbitrarily change the meaning of individual attributes.</p>
						<p>
							<i>Inert vs. descriptive properties of Acts:</i> Acts have two kinds of act properties, inert and descriptive properties.  Inert properties are not affected by the mood, descriptive properties follow the mood of the object.  For example, there is an identifier attribute Act.id, which gives a unique identification to an act object.  Being a unique identifier for the object is in no way dependent on the mood of the act object.  Therefore, the "interpretation" of the Act.id attribute is inert with respect to the act object's mood.</p>
						<p>By contrast, most of the Act class' attributes are descriptive for what the Act statement expresses.  Descriptive properties of the Act class give answer to the questions who, whom, where, with what, how and when the action is done.  The questions who, whom, with what, and where are answered by Participatons, while how and when is answered by descriptive attributes and ActRelationships.  The interpretation of a descriptive attribute is aligned to the interpretation of the entire act object, and controlled by the mood. </p>
						<p>
							<i>Examples:</i> To illustrate the effect of mood code, consider a "blood glucose" observation:</p>
						<p>The DEFINITION mood specifies the Act of "obtaining blood glucose". Participations describe in general the characteristics of the people who must be involved in the act, and the required objects, e.g., specimen, facility, equipment, etc. involved. The Observation.value specifies the absolute domain (range) of the observation (e.g., 15-500 mg/dl.)</p>
						<p>In INTENT mood the author of the intent expresses the intent that he or someone else "should obtain blood glucose". The participations are the people actually or supposedly involved in the intended act, especially the author of the intent or any individual assignments for group intents, and the objects actually or supposedly involved in the act (e.g., specimen sent, equipment requirements, etc.) The Observation.value is usually not specified, since the intent is not to measure blood glucose, not to measure blood glucose in a specific range. (But compare with GOAL below.)</p>
						<p>In ORDER mood, a kind of intent, the author requests to "please obtain blood glucose". The Participations are the people actually and supposedly involved in the act, especially the placer and the designated filler, and the objects actually or supposedly involved in the act (e.g., specimen sent, equipment requirements, etc.) The Observation.value is usually not specified, since the order is not to measure blood glucose in a specific range.</p>
						<p>In EVENT mood, the author states that "blood glucose was obtained". Participations are the people actually involved in the act, and the objects actually involved (e.g., specimen, facilities, equipment.) The Observation.value is the value actually obtained (e.g., 80 mg/dL, or &lt;15 mg/dL.)</p>
						<p>In event-CRITERION mood, an author considers a certain class of "obtaining blood glucose" possibly with a certain value (range) as outcome. The Participations constrain the criterion, for instance, to a particular patient. The Observation.value is the range in which the criterion would hold (e.g. &gt; 180 mg/dL or 200?300 mg/dL.)</p>
						<p>In GOAL mood (a kind of criterion) the author states that "our goal is to be able to obtain blood glucose with the given value (range)". The Participations are similar to intents, especially the author of the goal and the patient for whom the goal is made. The Observation.value is the range which defined when the goal is met (e.g.  80?120 mg/dl.)</p>
						<p>
							<i>Rationale:</i> The notion of "mood" is borrowed from natural language grammar, the mood of a verb (lat. modus verbi).  </p>
						<p>The notion of mood also resembles the various extensions of the logic of facts in modal logic and logic with modalities, where the moodCode specifies the modality (fact, possibility, intention, goal, etc.) under which the Act-statement is judged as appropriate or defective.</p>

						<p>A code specifying the motivation, cause, or rationale of an Act, when such rationale is not reasonably representable as an ActRelationship of type "has reason" linking to another Act.</p>
						<p>
							<i>Examples:</i> Example reasons that might qualify for being coded in this field might be: "routine requirement", "infectious disease reporting requirement", "on patient request", "required by law".</p>
						<p>Discussion </p>
						<p>Most reasons for acts can be clearly expressed by linking the new Act to another prior Act using an ActRelationship of type "has reason". This simply states that the prior Act is a reason for the new Act (see ActRelationship.) The prior act can then be a specific existing act or a textual explanation. This works for most cases, and the more specific the reason data is, the more should this reason ActRelationship be used instead of the reasonCode. </p>
						<p>The reasonCode remains as a place for common reasons that are not related to a prior Act or any other condition expressed in Acts. Indicators that something was required by law or was on the request of a patient etc. may qualify. However, if that piece of legislation, regulation, or the contract or the patient request can be represented as an Act (and they usually can), the reasonCode should not be used.</p>

					<text>
						<p>A code specifying when in the course of an Act a precondition for the Act is evaluated (e.g., before the Act starts for the first time, before every repetition, after each repetition but not before the first, or throughout the entire time of the Act.)</p>
						<p>
							<i>Discussion:</i> This attribute is part of the workflow control suite of attributes. An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Before each step is executed and has preconditions these conditions are tested and if the test is positive, the Act has clearance for execution. The repeatNumber may indicate that an Act may be repeatedly executed. The checkpointCode is specifies when the precondition is checked and is analogous to the various conditional statements and loop constructs in programming languages "while-do" vs. "do-while" or "repeat-until" vs. "loop-exit".</p>
						<p>For all checkpointCodes, except "end", preconditions are being checked at the time when the preceding step of the plan has terminated and this step would be next in the sequence established by the sequenceNumber attribute. </p>
						<p>When the checkpointCode for a criterion of a repeatable Act is "end", the criterion is tested only at the end of each repetition of that Act. When the condition holds true, the next repetition is ready for execution. </p>
						<p>When the checkpointCode is "entry" the criterion is checked at the beginning of each repetition (if any) whereas "beginning" means the criterion is checked only once before the repetition "loop" starts.</p>
						<p>The checkpointCode "through" is special in that it requires the condition to hold throughout the execution of the Act, even throughout a single execution. As soon as the condition turns false, the Act should receive an interrupt event (see interruptibleInd) and will eventually terminate.</p>
						<p>The checkpointCode "exit" is only used on a special plan step that represents a loop exit step. This allows an action plan to exit due to a condition tested inside the execution of this plan. Such exit criteria are sequenced with the other plan components using the ActRelationship.sequenceNumber.</p>

						<p>A code specifying how concurrent Acts are resynchronized in a parallel branch construct.</p>
						<p>
							<i>Discussion:</i> This attribute is part of the workflow control suite of attributes. An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Branches exist when multiple components have the same sequenceNumber. Branches are parallel if the splitCode specifies that more than one branch can be executed at the same time. The joinCode then specifies if and how the braches are resynchronized.</p>
						<p>The principal re-synchronization actions are (1) the control flow waits for a branch to terminate (wait-branch), (2) the branch that is not yet terminated is aborted (kill-branch), (3) the branch is not re-synchronized at all and continues in parallel (detached branch).</p>
						<p>A kill branch is only executed if there is at least one active wait (or exclusive wait) branch. If there is no other wait branch active, a kill branch is not started at all (rather than being aborted shortly after it is started.) Since a detached branch is unrelated to all other branches, active detached branches do not protect a kill-branch from being aborted.</p>

							<i>Discussion:</i> This attribute is part of the workflow control suite of attributes. An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Branches exist when multiple components have the same sequenceNumber. The splitCode specifies whether a branch is executed exclusively (case-switch) or inclusively, i.e., in parallel with other branches. </p>
						<p>In addition to exlusive and inclusive split the splitCode specifies how the pre-condition (also known as "guard conditions" on the branch) are evaluated. A guard condition may be evaluated once when the branching step is entered and if the conditions do not hold at that time, the branch is abandoned. Conversely execution of a branch may wait until the guard condition turns true.</p>
						<p>In exclusive wait branches, the first branch whose guard conditions turn true will be executed and all other branches abandoned. In inclusive wait branches some branches may already be executed while other branches still wait for their guard conditions to turn true.</p>

						<p>A code indicating whether the Act statement as a whole, with its subordinate components has been asserted to be uncertain in any way. </p>
						<p>
							<i>Examples:</i> Patient might have had a cholecystectomy procedure in the past (but isn't sure).</p>
						<p>
							<i>Constraints:</i> Uncertainty asserted using this attribute applies to the combined meaning of the Act statement established by all descriptive attributes (e.g., Act.code, Act.effectiveTime, Observation.value, SubstanceAdministration.doseQuantity, etc.), and the meanings of any components.</p>
						<p>
							<i>Discussion:</i>This is not intended for use to replace or compete with uncertainty associated with a Observation.values alone or other individual attributes of the class. Such pointed indications of uncertainty should be specified by applying the PPD, UVP or UVN data type extensions to the specific attribute. Particularly if the uncertainty is uncertainty of a quantitative measurement value, this must still be represented by a PPD&lt;PQ&gt; in the value and NOT using the uncertaintyCode. Also, when differential diagnoses are enumerated or weighed for probability, the UVP&lt;CD&gt; or UVN&lt;CD&gt; must be used, not the uncertaintyCode. The use of the uncertaintyCode is appropriate only if the entirety of the Act and its dependent Acts is questioned.</p>
						<p>Note that very vague uncertainty may be thought related to negationInd, however, the two concepts are really independent. One may be very uncertain about an event, but that does not mean that one is certain about the negation of the event.</p>

					<text>
						<p>In the United States, federal standards for classifying data on ethnicity determine the categories used by federal agencies and exert a strong influence on categorization by state and local agencies and private sector organizations. The federal standards do not conceptually define ethnicity, and they recognize the absence of an anthropological or scientific basis for ethnicity classification.  Instead, the federal standards acknowledge that ethnicity is a social-political construct in which an individual's own identification with a particular ethnicity is preferred to observer identification.  The standards specify two minimum ethnicity categories: Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino.  The standards define a Hispanic or Latino as a person of "Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central America, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race." The standards stipulate that ethnicity data need not be limited to the two minimum categories, but any expansion must be collapsible to those categories.  In addition, the standards stipulate that an individual can be Hispanic or Latino or can be Not Hispanic or Latino, but cannot be both.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Examples:</i> Blood pressure measurement method: arterial puncture vs. sphygmomanometer (Riva-Rocci), sitting vs. supine position, etc.   </p>
						<p>
							<i>Constraints:</i> In all observations the method is already partially specified by the Act.code. In this case, the methodCode NEED NOT be used at all. The methodCode MAY still be used to identify this method more clearly in addition to what is implied from the Act.code. However, an information consumer system or process SHOULD NOT depend on this methodCode information for method detail that is implied by the Act.code. </p>
						<p>If the methodCode is used to express method detail that is also implied by the Act.code, the methodCode MUST NOT be in conflict with the implied method of the Act.code.</p>
						<p>
							<i>Discussion:</i> In all observations the method is already partially specified by simply knowing the kind of observation (observation definition, Act.code) and this implicit information about the method does not need to be specified in Observation.methodCode. Particularly, most LOINC codes are defined for specific methods as long as the method makes a practical difference in interpretation. For example, the difference between susceptibility studies using the "minimal inhibitory concentration" (MIC) or the "agar diffusion method" (Kirby-Baur) are specifically assigned to different LOINC codes. The methodCode therefore is only an additional qualifier to specify what may not be known already from the Act.code.</p>
						<p>Also, some variances in methods may be tied to the particular device used. The methodCode should not be used to identify the specific device or test-kit material used in the observation. Such information about devices or test-kits should be associated with the observation as "device" participations.</p>

						<p>In the United States, federal standards for classifying data on race determine the categories used by federal agencies and exert a strong influence on categorization by state and local agencies and private sector organizations.  The federal standards do not conceptually define race, and they recognize the absence of an anthropological or scientific basis for racial classification.  Instead, the federal standards acknowledge that race is a social-political construct in which an individual's own identification with one more race categories is preferred to observer identification. The standards use a variety of features to define five minimum race categories. Among these features are descent from "the original peoples" of a specified region or nation.  The minimum race categories are American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White.  The federal standards stipulate that race data need not be limited to the five minimum categories, but any expansion must be collapsible to those categories.</p>

						<p>This table includes codes for the Role class hierarchy.  The values in this hierarchy, represent a Role which is an association or relationship between two entities - the entity that plays the role and the entity that scopes the role.  Roles names are derived from the name of the playing entity in that role.</p>
						<p>The role hierarchy stems from three core concepts, or abstract domains:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									<b>RoleClassOntological</b> is an abstract domain that collects roles in which the playing entity is defined or specified by the scoping entity.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<b>RoleClassPartitive</b> collects roles in which the playing entity is in some sense a "part" of the scoping entity.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<b>RoleClassAssociative</b> collects all of the remaining forms of association between the playing entity and the scoping entity. This set of roles is further partitioned between:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p>
											<b>RoleClassPassive</b> which are roles in which the playing entity is used, known, treated, handled, built, or destroyed, etc. under the auspices of the scoping entity. The playing entity is passive in these roles in that the role exists without an agreement from the playing entity.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<b>RoleClassMutualRelationship</b> which are relationships based on mutual behavior of the two entities. The basis of these relationship may be formal agreements or they may be <i>de facto</i> behavior.  Thus, this sub-domain is further divided into:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<p>
													<b>RoleClassRelationshipFormal</b> in which the relationship is formally defined, frequently by a contract or agreement.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													<b>Personal relationship</b> which inks two people in a personal relationship. </p>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The hierarchy discussed above is represented In the current vocabulary tables as a set of abstract domains, with the exception of the  "Personal relationship" which is a leaf concept.</p>

							<b>Description:</b>This describes which path the administered medication takes to get into the body or into contact with the body and constitutes part of the <i>where</i> (the other part being site - see below). It is the <i>way in</i> or the course the medication must take to get to its destination.</p>
						<p>Note that a path is in no sense a description of a <i>final destination</i>; it is a stylized description of the path taken. For example, an oral antibiotic may be used to treat a severe infection on a toe; the oral route is used to get the medicine to be able to reach and treat the infection in the toe. For some specific routes of administration there may be an incidental sense of <i>final destination</i>, for example an ocular administration usually occurs when treatment of an eye condition is required. However, this is in no sense definitional: rectal administration of a medicine may be for a local effect (a steroid foam for treatment of colitis) or for a systemic effect (metronidazole for treatment of infection). The route of administration of a medicine should only be a description of the path taken and not the form.</p>
						<p>
							<b>Examples:</b>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>oral</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>rectal</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>intravenous (IV)</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>subcutaneous (SC)</p>
							</li>

								<p>A record of something that is being done, has been done, can be done, or is intended or requested to be done.</p>
								<p>
									<i>Examples:</i>The kinds of acts that are common in health care are (1) a clinical observation, (2) an assessment of health condition (such as problems and diagnoses), (3) healthcare goals, (4) treatment services (such as medication, surgery, physical and psychological therapy), (5) assisting, monitoring or attending, (6) training and education services to patients and their next of kin, (7) and notary services (such as advanced directives or living will), (8)  editing and maintaining documents, and many others.</p>
								<p>
									<i>Discussion and Rationale:</i> Acts are the pivot of the RIM; all domain information and processes are represented primarily in Acts. Any profession or business, including healthcare, is primarily constituted of intentional and occasionally non-intentional actions, performed and recorded by responsible actors. An Act-instance is a record of such an action.</p>
								<p>Acts connect to Entities in their Roles through Participations and connect to other Acts through ActRelationships. Participations are the authors, performers and other responsible parties as well as subjects and beneficiaries (which includes tools and material used in the performance of the act, which are also subjects). The moodCode distinguishes between Acts that are meant as factual records, vs. records of intended or ordered services, and the other modalities in which act can appear.</p>
								<p>One of the Participations that all acts have (at least implicitly) is a primary author, who is responsible of the Act and who "owns" the act. Responsibility for the act means responsibility for what is being stated in the Act and as what it is stated. Ownership of the act is assumed in the sense of who may operationally modify the same act. Ownership and responsibility of the Act is not the same as ownership or responsibility of what the Act-object refers to in the real world. The same real world activity can be described by two people, each being the author of their Act, describing the same real world activity. Yet one can be a witness while the other can be a principal performer. The performer has responsibilities for the physical actions; the witness only has responsibility for making a true statement to the best of his or her ability. The two Act-instances may even disagree, but because each is properly attributed to its author, such disagreements can exist side by side and left to arbitration by a recipient of these Act-instances.</p>
								<p>In this sense, an Act-instance represents a "statement" according to Rector and Nowlan (1991) [Foundations for an electronic medical record. Methods Inf Med. 30.]  Rector and Nowlan have emphasized the importance of understanding the medical record not as a collection of facts, but "a faithful record of what clinicians have heard, seen, thought, and done." Rector and Nowlan go on saying that "the other requirements for a medical record, e.g., that it be attributable and permanent, follow naturally from this view." Indeed the Act class is this attributable statement, and the rules of updating acts (discussed in the state-transition model, see Act.statusCode) versus generating new Act-instances are designed according to this principle of permanent attributable statements.</p>
								<p>Rector and Nolan focus on the electronic medical record as a collection of statements, while attributed statements, these are still mostly factual statements. However, the Act class goes beyond this limitation to attributed factual statements, representing what is known as "speech-acts" in linguistics and philosophy.  The notion of speech-act includes that there is pragmatic meaning in language utterances, aside from just factual statements; and that these utterances interact with the real world to change the state of affairs, even directly cause physical activities to happen. For example, an order is a speech act that (provided it is issued adequately) will cause the ordered action to be physically performed. The speech act theory has culminated in the seminal work by Austin (1962) [How to do things with words. Oxford University Press].</p>
								<p>An activity in the real world may progress from defined, through planned and ordered to executed, which is represented as the mood of the Act. Even though one might think of a single activity as progressing from planned to executed, this progression is reflected by multiple Act-instances, each having one and only one mood that will not change along the Act-instance life cycle.  This is because the attribution and content of speech acts along this progression of an activity may be different, and it is often critical that a permanent and faithful record be maintained of this progression. The specification of orders or promises or plans must not be overwritten by the specification of what was actually done, so as to allow comparing actions with their earlier specifications. Act-instances that describe this progression of the same real world activity are linked through the ActRelationships (of the relationship category "sequel").</p>
								<p>Act as statements or speech-acts are the only representation of real world facts or processes in the HL7 RIM. The truth about the real world is constructed through a combination (and arbitration) of such attributed statements only, and there is no class in the RIM whose objects represent "objective state of affairs" or "real processes" independent from attributed statements. As such, there is no distinction between an activity and its documentation. Every Act includes both to varying degrees. For example, a factual statement made about recent (but past) activities, authored (and signed) by the performer of such activities, is commonly known as a procedure report or original documentation (e.g., surgical procedure report, clinic note etc.). Conversely, a status update on an activity that is presently in progress, authored by the performer (or a close observer) is considered to capture that activity (and is later superceded by a full procedure report). However, both status update and procedure report are acts of the same kind, only distinguished by mood and state (see statusCode) and completeness of the information.</p>

									<b>Definition:</b> An ACT that organizes a set of component acts into a semantic grouping that share a particular context such as timeframe, patient, etc.</p>
								<p>
									<b>UsageNotes:</b> The focus in a GROUPER act is the grouping of the contained acts.  For example "a request to group" (RQO), "a type of grouping that is allowed to occur" (DEF), etc.</p>
								<p>Unlike WorkingList, which represents a dynamic, shared, continuously updated collection to provide a "view" of a set of objects, GROUPER collections tend to be static and simply indicate a shared set of semantics.  Note that sharing of semantics can be achieved using ACT as well.  However, with GROUPER, the sole semantic is of grouping.</p>

								<p>A Region of Interest (ROI) specified for a multidimensional observation, such as an Observation Series (OBSSER). The ROI is specified using a set of observation criteria, each delineating the boundary of the region in one of the dimensions in the multidimensional observation. The relationship between a ROI and its referenced Act is specified through an ActRelationship of type subject (SUBJ), which must always be present. Each of the boundary criteria observations is connected with the ROI using ActRelationships of type "has component" (COMP). In each boundary criterion, the Act.code names the dimension and the Observation.value specifies the range of values inside the region. Typically the bounded dimension is continuous, and so the Observation.value will be an interval (IVL) data type. The Observation.value need not be specified if the respective dimension is only named but not constrained. For example, an ROI for the QT interval of a certain beat in ECG Lead II would contain 2 boundary criteria, one naming the interval in time (constrained), and the other naming the interval in ECG Lead II (only named, but not constrained).</p>

								<p>The Consent class represents informed consents and all similar medico-legal transactions between the patient (or his legal guardian) and the provider. Examples are informed consent for surgical procedures, informed consent for clinical trials, advanced beneficiary notice, against medical advice decline from service, release of information agreement, etc.</p>
								<p>The details of consents vary. Often an institution has a number of different consent forms for various purposes, including reminding the physician about the topics to mention. Such forms also include patient education material. In electronic medical record communication, consents thus are information-generating acts on their own and need to be managed similar to medical activities. Thus, Consent is modeled as a special class of Act.</p>
								<p>The "signatures" to the consent document are represented electronically through Participation instances to the consent object. Typically an informed consent has Participation.typeCode of "performer", the healthcare provider informing the patient, and "consenter", the patient or legal guardian. Some consent may associate a witness or a notary public (e.g., living wills, advanced directives). In consents where a healthcare provider is not required (e.g. living will), the performer may be the patient himself or a notary public.</p>
								<p>Some consent has a minimum required delay between the consent and the service, so as to allow the patient to rethink his decisions. This minimum delay can be expressed in the act definition by the ActRelationship.pauseQuantity attribute that delays the service until the pause time has elapsed after the consent has been completed.</p>

								<p>An interaction between entities that provides opportunity for transmission of a physical, chemical, or biological agent from an exposure source entity to an exposure target entity.</p>
								<p>
									<i>Examples:  </i>The following examples are provided to indicate what interactions are considered exposures rather than other types of Acts:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p>A patient accidentally receives three times the recommended dose of their medication due to a dosing error. </p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<p>This is a substance administration.  Public health and/or safety authorities may also be interested in documenting this with an associated exposure.</p>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>A patient accidentally is dispensed an incorrect medicine (e.g., clomiphene instead of clomipramine).  They have taken several doses before the mistake is detected.  They are therefore "exposed" to a medicine that there was no therapeutic indication for them to receive. </p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<p>There are several substance administrations in this example.  Public health and/or safety authorities may also be interested in documenting this with associated exposures.</p>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>In a busy medical ward, a patient is receiving chemotherapy for a lymphoma.  Unfortunately, the IV infusion bag containing the medicine splits, spraying cytotoxic medication over the patient being treated and the patient in the adjacent bed. </p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<p>There are three substance administrations in this example.  The first is the intended one (IV infusion) with its associated (implicit) exposure.  There is an incident with an associated substance administration to the same patient involving the medication sprayed over the patient as well as an associated exposure.  Additionally, the incident includes a substance administration involving the spraying of medication on the adjacent patient, also with an associated exposure.</p>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>A patient who is a refugee from a war-torn African nation arrives in a busy inner city A&amp;E department suffering from a cough with bloody sputum.  Not understanding the registration and triage process, they sit in the waiting room for several hours before it is noticed that they have not booked in.  As soon as they are being processed, it is suspected that they are suffering from TB.  Vulnerable (immunosuppressed) patients who were sharing the waiting room with this patient may have been exposed to the tubercule bacillus, and must be traced for investigation. </p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<p>This is an exposure (or possibly multiple exposures) in the waiting room involving the refugee and everyone else in the waiting room during the period.  There might also be a number of known or presumed substance administrations (coughing) via several possible routes.  The substance administrations are only hypotheses until confirmed by further testing.</p>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>A patient who has received an elective total hip replacement procedure suffers a prolonged stay in hospital, due to contracting an MRSA infection in the surgical wound site after the surgery. </p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<p>This is an exposure to MRSA.  Although there was some sort of substance administration, it's possible the exact mechanism for introduction of the MRSA into the wound will not be identified.</p>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Routine maintenance of the X-ray machines at a local hospital reveals a serious breach of the shielding on one of the machines.  Patients who have undergone investigations using that machine in the last month are likely to have been exposed to significantly higher doses of X-rays than was intended, and must be tracked for possible adverse effects. </p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<p>There has been an exposure of each patient who used the machine in the past 30 days. Some patients may have had substance administrations.</p>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>A new member of staff is employed in the laundry processing room of a small cottage hospital, and a misreading of the instructions for adding detergents results in fifty times the usual concentration of cleaning materials being added to a batch of hospital bedding.  As a result, several patients have been exposed to very high levels of detergents still present in the "clean" bedding, and have experienced dermatological reactions to this. </p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<p>There has been an incident with multiple exposures to several patients.  Although there are substance administrations involving the application of the detergent to the skin of the patients, it is expected that the substance administrations would not be directly documented.</p>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Seven patients who are residents in a health care facility for the elderly mentally ill have developed respiratory problems. After several months of various tests having been performed and various medications prescribed to these patients, the problem is traced to their being "sensitive" to a new fungicide used in the wall plaster of the ward where these patients reside.</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<p>The patients have been continuously exposed to the fungicide.  Although there have been continuous substance administrations (via breathing) this would not normally be documented as a substance administration.</p>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>A patient with osteoarthritis of the knees is treated symptomatically using analgesia, paracetamol (acetaminophen) 1g up to four times a day for pain relief.  His GP does not realize that the patient has, 20 years previously (while at college) had severe alcohol addiction problems, and now, although this is completely under control, his liver has suffered significantly, leaving him more sensitive to hepatic toxicity from paracetamol use.  Later that year, the patient returns with a noticeable level of jaundice.  Paracetamol is immediately withdrawn and alternative solutions for the knee pain are sought.  The jaundice gradually subsides with conservative management, but referral to the gastroenterologist is required for advice and monitoring. </p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<p>There is a substance administration with an associated exposure.  The exposure component is based on the relative toxic level of the substance to a patient with a compromised liver function.</p>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>A patient goes to their GP complaining of abdominal pain, having been discharged from the local hospital ten days' previously after an emergency appendectomy.  The GP can find nothing particularly amiss, and presumes it is post operative surgical pain that will resolve.  The patient returns a fortnight later, when the GP prescribes further analgesia, but does decide to request an outpatient surgical follow-up appointment.  At this post-surgical outpatient review, the registrar decides to order an ultrasound, which, when performed three weeks later, shows a small faint inexplicable mass.  A laparoscopy is then performed, as a day case procedure, and a piece of a surgical swab is removed from the patient's abdominal cavity.  Thankfully, a full recovery then takes place. </p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<p>This is a procedural sequelae.  There may be an Incident recorded for this also.</p>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>A patient is slightly late for a regular pacemaker battery check in the Cardiology department of the local hospital.  They are hurrying down the second floor corridor.  A sudden summer squall has recently passed over the area, and rain has come in through an open corridor window leaving a small puddle on the corridor floor.  In their haste, the patient slips in the puddle and falls so badly that they have to be taken to the A&amp;E department, where it is discovered on investigation they have slightly torn the cruciate ligament in their left knee. </p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<p>This is not an exposure.  There has been an incident.  </p>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									<i>Usage Notes:</i> This class deals only with opportunity and not the outcome of the exposure; i.e. not all exposed parties will necessarily experience actual harm or benefit.</p>
								<p>Exposure differs from Substance Administration by the absence of the participation of a performer in the act. </p>
								<p>The following participations SHOULD be used with the following participations to distinguish the specific entities:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p>The exposed entity participates via the "exposure target" (EXPTRGT) participation.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>An entity that has carried the agent transmitted in the exposure participates via the "exposure source" (EXSRC) participation.  For example: </p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<p>a person or animal who carried an infectious disease and interacts (EXSRC) with another person or animal (EXPTRGT) transmitting the disease agent;</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>a place or other environment (EXSRC) and a person or animal (EXPTRGT) who is exposed in the presence of this environment.</p>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>When it is unknown whether a participating entity is the source of the agent (EXSRC) or the target of the transmission (EXPTRGT), the "exposure participant" (EXPART) is used.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>The physical (including energy), chemical or biological substance which is participating in the exposure uses the "exposure agent" (EXPAGNT) participation.  There are at least three scenarios:</p>

											<li>
												<p>the player of the Role that participates as EXPAGNT is the chemical or biological substance mixed or carried by the scoper-entity of the Role (e.g., ingredient role); or </p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>the player of the Role that participates as EXPAGNT is a mixture known to contain the chemical, radiological or biological substance of interest; or </p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>the player of the Role that participates as a EXPAGNT is known to carry the agent (i.e., the player is a fomite, vector, etc.).</p>
											</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>The Exposure.statusCode attribute should be interpreted as the state of the Exposure business object (e.g., active, aborted, completed) and not the clinical status of the exposure (e.g., probable, confirmed).  The clinical status of the exposure should be associated with the exposure via a subject observation.</p>
								<p>
									<i>Design Comment: </i>The usage notes require a clear criterion for determining whether an act is an exposure or substance administration-deleterious potential, uncertainty of actual transmission, or otherwise. SBADM states that the criterion is the presence of a performer-but there are examples above that call this criterion into question (e.g., the first one, concerning a dosing error).</p>

									<b>Description:</b>An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The <b>code</b> attribute of Observation and the <b>value</b> attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.</p>
								<p>
									<b>Discussion:</b>
								</p>
								<p>Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a  variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.</p>
								<p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects. </p>
								<p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p>
								<p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.</p>
								<p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC. </p>
								<p>Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation. </p>
								<p>
									<b>Examples:</b>
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p>Recording the results of a Family History Assessment</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Laboratory test and associated result</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Physical exam test and associated result</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Device temperature</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Soil lead level</p>

								<p>Supply orders and deliveries are simple Acts that focus on the delivered product. The product is associated with the Supply Act via Participation.typeCode="product". With general Supply Acts, the precise identification of the Material (manufacturer, serial numbers, etc.) is important.  Most of the detailed information about the Supply should be represented using the Material class.  If delivery needs to be scheduled, tracked, and billed separately, one can associate a Transportation Act with the Supply Act.  Pharmacy dispense services are represented as Supply Acts, associated with a SubstanceAdministration  Act. The SubstanceAdministration class represents the administration of medication, while dispensing is supply.</p>

								<p>A public health case is an Observation representing a condition or event that has a specific significance for public health. Typically it involves an instance or instances of a reportable infectious disease or other condition. The public health case can include a health-related event concerning a single individual or it may refer to multiple health-related events that are occurrences of the same disease or condition of interest to public health. An outbreak involving multiple individuals may be considered as a type of public health case. A public health case definition (Act.moodCode = "definition") includes the description of the clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic indicators associated with a disease or condition of interest to public health. There are case definitions for conditions that are reportable, as well as for those that are not. There are also case definitions for outbreaks. A public health case definition is a construct used by public health for the purpose of counting cases, and should not be used as clinical indications for treatment. Examples include AIDS, toxic-shock syndrome, and salmonellosis and their associated indicators that are used to define a case.</p>

									<b>Definition: </b>An observation that is composed of a set of observations. These observations typically have a logical or practical grouping for generally accepted clinical or functional purposes, such as observations that are run together because of automation. A battery can define required and optional component observations and, in some cases, will define complex rules that determine whether or not a particular observation is made. BATTERY is a constraint on the Observation class in that it is understood to always be composed of component observations.</p>
								<p>
									<b>UsageNotes: </b>The focus in a BATTERY is that it is composed of individual observations. In request (RQO) mood, a battery is a request to perform the component observations. In event (EVN) mood a battery is a reporting of associated set of observation events. In definition mood a battery is the definition of the associated set of observations.</p>

								<p>Container for Correlated Observation Sequences sharing a common frame of reference.  All Observations of the same cd must be comparable and relative to the common frame of reference.

And, all 4 OBSCOR would be contained in one OBSSER because all the times are relative to the same origin (beginning of the recording) and all the ECG signals were from a fixed set of electrodes.</p>

E.g. the values in position 2 in all the LIST&lt;&gt;'s are correlated.  This is analogous to a table where each column is an Observation Sequence with a LIST&lt;&gt; of values, and each row in the table is a correlation between the columns.

									<b>Definition:</b> A request act that is specialized for an event request/fulfillment cycle. </p>
								<p>
									<b>UsageNotes:</b> The fulfillment cycle may involve intermediary fulfilling acts in moods such as PRMS, APT, or even another RQO before being fulfilled by the final event. </p>
								<p>
									<b>UsageNotes:</b> The concepts of a "request" and an "order" are viewed as different, because there is an implication of a mandate associated with order.  In practice, however, this distinction has no general functional value in the inter-operation of health care computing.  "Orders" are commonly refused for a variety of clinical and business reasons, and the notion of a "request" obligates the recipient (the fulfiller) to respond to the sender (the author).  Indeed, in many regions, including Australia and Europe, the common term used is "request."</p>
								<p>Thus, the concept embodies both notions, as there is no useful distinction to be made.  If a mandate is to be associated with a request, this will be embodied in the "local" business rules applied to the transactions.  Should HL7 desire to provide a distinction between these in the future, the individual concepts could be added as specializations of this concept.</p>
								<p>The critical distinction here, is the difference between this concept and an "intent", of which it is a specialization.  An intent involves decisions by a single party, the author.  A request, however, involves decisions by two parties, the author and the fulfiller, with an obligation on the part of the fulfiller to respond to the request indicating that the fulfiller will indeed fulfill the request.</p>

									<b>Definition:</b> An expectation that is considered to be desirable to occur in the future </p>
								<p>
									<b>Examples:</b>Target weight below 80Kg, Stop smoking, Regain ability to walk, goal is to administer thrombolytics to candidate patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction.</p>
								<p>
									<b>UsageNotes:</b> INT (intent) reflects a plan for the future, which is a declaration to do something.  This contrasts with goal which doesn't represent an intention to act, merely a hope for an eventual result.  A goal is distinct from the intended actions to reach that goal.  "I will reduce the dose of drug x to 20mg" is an intent.  "I hope to be able to get the patient to the point where I can reduce the dose of drug x to 20mg" is a goal. EXPEC (expectation) reflects a prediction rather than a hope. RSK (risk) reflects a potential negative event rather than a hope.</p>

								<p>
									<b>UsageNotes:</b>Note: An observation in RSK mood expresses the undesirable act, and not the underlying risk factor. A risk factor that is present (e.g. obesity, smoking, etc) should be expressed in event mood. INT (intent) reflects a plan for the future, which is a declaration to do something. This contrasts with RSK (risk), which is the potential that something negative will occur that may or may not ever happen. GOL (goal) reflects a hope to achieve something. EXPEC (expectation) is the prediction of a positive or negative event. This contrasts with RSK (risk), which is the potential that something negative will occur that may or may not ever happen, and may not be expected to happen.</p>

								<p>An act relationship indicating that the source act follows the target act. The source act should in principle represent the same kind of act as the target. Source and target need not have the same mood code (mood will often differ). The target of a sequel is called antecedent. Examples for sequel relationships are: revision, transformation, derivation from a prototype (as a specialization is a derivation of a generalization), followup, realization, instantiation.</p>

								<p>Indicates that the source act makes use of (or will make use of) the information content of the target act.</p>
								<p>
									<i>UsageNotes: </i>A usage relationship only makes sense if the target act is authored and occurs independently of the source act.  Otherwise a simpler relationship such as COMP would be appropriate.</p>
								<p>
									<i>Rationale: </i>There is a need when defining a clinical trial protocol to indicate that the protocol makes use of other protocol or treatment specifications.  This is stronger than the assertion of "references".  References may exist without usage, and in a clinical trial protocol is common to assert both: what other specifications does this trial use and what other specifications does it merely reference.</p>

								<p>A specialization of "has support" (SPRT), used to relate a secondary observation to a Region of Interest on a multidimensional observation, if the ROI specifies the true boundaries of the secondary observation as opposed to only marking the approximate area.  For example, if the start and end of an ST elevation episode is visible in an EKG, this relation would indicate the ROI bounds the  "ST elevation" observation -- the ROI defines the true beginning and ending of the episode.  Conversely, if a ROI simply contains ST elevation, but it does not define the bounds (start and end) of the episode, the more general "has support" relation is used.  Likewise, if a ROI on an image defines the true bounds of a "1st degree burn", the relation "has bounded support" is used; but if the ROI only points to the approximate area of the burn, the general "has support" relation is used.</p>

								<p>Target on behalf of whom the service happens, but that is not necessarily present in the service.  Can occur together with direct target to indicate that a target is both, as in the case where the patient is the indirect beneficiary of a service rendered to a family member, e.g. counseling or given home care instructions.  This concept includes a participant, such as a covered party, who derives benefits from a service act covered by a coverage act.</p>
								<p>Note that the semantic role of the intended recipient who benefits from the happening denoted by the verb in the clause.  Thus, a patient who has no coverage under a policy or program may be a beneficiary of a health service while not being the beneficiary of coverage for that service.</p>

									<b>Definition:</b> A person, non-person living subject, organization or device that who actually and principally carries out the action. Device should only be assigned as a performer in circumstances where the device is performing independent of human intervention.  Need not be the principal responsible actor.</p>
								<p>
									<b>Exampe:</b> A surgery resident operating under supervision of attending surgeon, a search and rescue dog locating survivors, an electronic laboratory analyzer or the laboratory discipline requested to perform a laboratory test. The performer may also be the patient in self-care, e.g. fingerstick blood sugar. The traditional order filler is a performer. This information should accompany every service event.</p>
								<p>
									<b>Note:</b> that existing HL7 designs assign an organization as the playing entity of the Role that is the performer.  These designs should be revised in subsequent releases to make this the scooping entity for the role involved.</p>

						<p>Codes for the Role class hierarchy.  The values in this hierarchy, represent a Role which is an association or relationship between two entities - the entity that plays the role and the entity that scopes the role.  Roles names are derived from the name of the playing entity in that role.</p>
						<p>The role hierarchy stems from three core concepts, or abstract domains:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									<b>RoleClassOntological</b> is an abstract domain that collects roles in which the playing entity is defined or specified by the scoping entity.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<b>RoleClassPartitive</b> collects roles in which the playing entity is in some sense a "part" of the scoping entity.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<b>RoleClassAssociative</b> collects all of the remaining forms of association between the playing entity and the scoping entity. This set of roles is further partitioned between:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p>
											<b>RoleClassPassive</b> which are roles in which the playing entity is used, known, treated, handled, built, or destroyed, etc. under the auspices of the scoping entity. The playing entity is passive in these roles in that the role exists without an agreement from the playing entity.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<b>RoleClassMutualRelationship</b> which are relationships based on mutual behavior of the two entities. The basis of these relationship may be formal agreements or they may be <i>de facto</i> behavior.  Thus, this sub-domain is further divided into:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<p>
													<b>RoleClassRelationshipFormal</b> in which the relationship is formally defined, frequently by a contract or agreement.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													<b>Personal relationship</b> which inks two people in a personal relationship. </p>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The hierarchy discussed above is represented In the current vocabulary tables as a set of abstract domains, with the exception of the  "Personal relationship" which is a leaf concept.</p>
						<p>

									<b>Description: </b>Specifies the player Entity (the equivalent Entity) as an Entity that is considered to be equivalent to a reference Entity (scoper).  The equivalence is in principle a symmetric relationship, however, it is expected that the scoper is a reference entity which serves as reference entity for multiple different equivalent entities. </p>
								<p>
									<b>Examples: </b>An innovator's medicine formulation is the reference for "generics", i.e., formulations manufactured differently but having been proven to be biologically equivalent to the reference medicine. Another example is a reference ingredient that serves as basis for quantity specifications (basis of strength, e.g., metoprolol succinate specified in terms of metoprolol tartrate.)</p>

								<p>A role played by an entity, usually an organization that is the sponsor of an insurance plan or a health program. A sponsor is the party that is ultimately accountable for the coverage by employment contract or by law.  A sponsor can be an employer, union, government agency, or association.  Fully insured sponsors establish the terms of the plan and contract with health insurance plans to assume the risk and to administer the plan.  Self-insured sponsors delegate coverage administration, but not risk, to third-party administrators.  Program sponsors designate services to be covered in accordance with statute.   Program sponsors may administer the coverage themselves, delegate coverage administration, but not risk to third-party administrators, or contract with health insurance plans to assume the risk and administrator a program. Sponsors qualify individuals who may become </p>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<p>a policy holder of the plan;</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>where the sponsor is the policy holder, who may become a subscriber or a dependent to a policy under the plan; or</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>where the sponsor is a government agency, who may become program eligibles under a program. </p>

								<p>The sponsor role may be further qualified by the SponsorRole.code.  Entities playing the sponsor role may also play the role of a Coverage Administrator.</p>

									<b>Description:</b> A role played by a party making a claim for coverage under a policy or program.  A claimant must be either a person or organization, or a group of persons or organizations.  A claimant is not a named insured or a program eligible.</p>
								<p>
									<b>Discussion:</b> With respect to liability insurance such as property and casualty insurance, a claimant must file a claim requesting indemnification for a loss that the claimant considers covered under the policy of a named insured.  The claims adjuster for the policy underwriter will review the claim to determine whether the loss meets the benefit coverage criteria under a policy, and base any indemnification or coverage payment on that review.  If a third party is liable in whole or part for the loss, the underwriter may pursue third party liability recovery.  A claimant may be involved in civil or criminal legal proceedings involving claims against a defendant party that is indemnified by an insurance policy or to protest the finding of a claims adjustor. With respect to life insurance, a beneficiary designated by a named insured becomes a claimant of the proceeds of coverage, as in the case of a life insurance policy.  However, a claimant for coverage under life insurance is not necessarily a designated beneficiary.</p>
								<p>
									<b>Note:</b> A claimant is not a named insured.  However, a named insured may make a claim under a policy, e.g., an insured driver may make a claim for an injury under his or her comprehensive automobile insurance policy.  Similarly, a program eligible may make a claim under program, e.g., an unemployed worker may claim benefits under an unemployment insurance program, but parties playing these covered party role classes are not, for purposes of this vocabulary and in an effort to clearly distinguish role classes, considered claimants.</p>
								<p>In the case of a named insured making a claim, a role type code INSCLM (insured claimant) subtypes the class to indicate that either a named insured or an individual insured has filed a claim for a loss.  In the case of a program eligible, a role type code INJWKR (injured worker) subtypes the class to indicate that the covered party in a workers compensation program is an injured worker, and as such, has filed a "claim" under the program for benefits.  Likewise, a covered role type code UNEMP (unemployed worker) subtypes the program eligible class to indicate that the covered party in an unemployment insurance program has filed a claim for unemployment benefits.</p>
								<p>
									<b>Example:</b> A claimant under automobile policy that is not the named insured.</p>

									<b>Description:</b> A role played by a party to an insurance policy to which the insurer agrees to indemnify for losses, provides benefits for, or renders services.  A named insured may be either a person, non-person living subject, or an organization, or a group of persons, non-person living subjects, or organizations.</p>
								<p>
									<b>Discussion:</b> The coded concept NAMED should not be used where a more specific child concept in this Specializable value set applies.  In some cases, the named insured may not be the policy holder, e.g., where a policy holder purchases life insurance policy in which another party is the named insured and the policy holder is the beneficiary of the policy.</p>
								<p>
									<b>Note:</b> The party playing the role of a named insured is not a claimant in the sense conveyed by the RoleClassCoveredParty CLAIM (claimant).  However, a named insured may make a claim under a policy, e.g., e.g., a party that is the named insured and policy holder under a comprehensive automobile insurance policy may become the claimant for coverage under that policy e.g., if injured in an automobile accident and there is no liable third party.  In the case of a named insured making a claim, a role type code INSCLM (insured claimant) subtypes the class to indicate that a named insured has filed a claim for a loss.</p>
								<p>
									<b>Example:</b> The named insured under a comprehensive automobile, disability, or property and casualty policy that is the named insured and may or may not be the policy holder.</p>

									<b>Description:</b> A role played by a person covered under a policy or program based on an association with a subscriber, which is recognized by the policy holder.</p>
								<p>
									<b>Note:</b>  The party playing the role of a dependent is not a claimant in the sense conveyed by the RoleClassCoveredParty CLAIM (claimant).  However, a dependent may make a claim under a policy, e.g., a dependent under a health insurance policy may become the claimant for coverage under that policy for wellness examines or if injured and there is no liable third party.  In the case of a dependent making a claim, a role type code INSCLM (insured claimant) subtypes the class to indicate that the dependent has filed a claim for services covered under the health insurance policy.</p>
								<p>
									<b>Example:</b> The dependent has an association with the subscriber such as a financial dependency or personal relationship such as that of a spouse, or a natural or adopted child.  The policy holder may be required by law to recognize certain associations or may have discretion about the associations.  For example, a policy holder may dictate the criteria for the dependent status of adult children who are students, such as requiring full time enrollment, or may recognize domestic partners as dependents.  Under certain circumstances, the dependent may be under the indirect authority of a responsible party acting as a surrogate for the subscriber, for example, if the subscriber is differently abled or deceased, a guardian ad Lidem or estate executor may be appointed to assume the subscriberaTMs legal standing in the relationship with the dependent.</p>

						<p>A code specifying the meaning and purpose of every ActRelationship instance. Each of its values implies specific constraints to what kinds of Act objects can be related and in which way.</p>

							<i>Discussion:</i> The types of act relationships fall under one of 5 categories:</p>
						<p>1.) (De)-composition, with composite (source) and component (target)</p>
						<p>2.) Sequel which includes follow-up, fulfillment, instantiation, replacement, transformation, etc. that all have in common that source and target are Acts of essentially the same kind but with variances in mood and other attributes, and where the target exists before the source and the source refers to the target that it links back to.</p>
						<p>3.) Pre-condition, trigger, reason, contraindication, with the conditioned Act at the source and the condition or reason at the target.</p>
						<p>4.) Post-condition, outcome, goal and risk, with the Act at the source having the outcome or goal at the target.</p>
						<p>5.) A host of functional relationships including support, cause, derivation, etc. generalized under the notion of "pertinence".</p>

						<p>A code specifying when in the course of an Act a precondition for the Act is evaluated (e.g., before the Act starts for the first time, before every repetition, after each repetition but not before the first, or throughout the entire time of the Act.)</p>
						<p>
							<i>Discussion:</i> This attribute is part of the workflow control suite of attributes. An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Before each step is executed and has preconditions these conditions are tested and if the test is positive, the Act has clearance for execution. The repeatNumber may indicate that an Act may be repeatedly executed. The checkpointCode is specifies when the precondition is checked and is analogous to the various conditional statements and loop constructs in programming languages "while-do" vs. "do-while" or "repeat-until" vs. "loop-exit".</p>
						<p>For all checkpointCodes, except "end", preconditions are being checked at the time when the preceding step of the plan has terminated and this step would be next in the sequence established by the sequenceNumber attribute. </p>
						<p>When the checkpointCode for a criterion of a repeatable Act is "end", the criterion is tested only at the end of each repetition of that Act. When the condition holds true, the next repetition is ready for execution. </p>
						<p>When the checkpointCode is "entry" the criterion is checked at the beginning of each repetition (if any) whereas "beginning" means the criterion is checked only once before the repetition "loop" starts.</p>
						<p>The checkpointCode "through" is special in that it requires the condition to hold throughout the execution of the Act, even throughout a single execution. As soon as the condition turns false, the Act should receive an interrupt event (see interruptibleInd) and will eventually terminate.</p>
						<p>The checkpointCode "exit" is only used on a special plan step that represents a loop exit step. This allows an action plan to exit due to a condition tested inside the execution of this plan. Such exit criteria are sequenced with the other plan components using the ActRelationship.sequenceNumber.</p>

						<p>A code specifying how branches in an action plan are selected among other branches.</p>

							<i>Discussion:</i> This attribute is part of the workflow control suite of attributes. An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Branches exist when multiple components have the same sequenceNumber. The splitCode specifies whether a branch is executed exclusively (case-switch) or inclusively, i.e., in parallel with other branches. </p>
						<p>In addition to exlusive and inclusive split the splitCode specifies how the pre-condition (also known as "guard conditions" on the branch) are evaluated. A guard condition may be evaluated once when the branching step is entered and if the conditions do not hold at that time, the branch is abandoned. Conversely execution of a branch may wait until the guard condition turns true.</p>
						<p>In exclusive wait branches, the first branch whose guard conditions turn true will be executed and all other branches abandoned. In inclusive wait branches some branches may already be executed while other branches still wait for their guard conditions to turn true.</p>

						<p>A code specifying how concurrent Acts are resynchronized in a parallel branch construct.</p>
						<p>
							<i>Discussion:</i> This attribute is part of the workflow control suite of attributes. An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Branches exist when multiple components have the same sequenceNumber. Branches are parallel if the splitCode specifies that more than one branch can be executed at the same time. The joinCode then specifies if and how the braches are resynchronized.</p>
						<p>The principal re-synchronization actions are (1) the control flow waits for a branch to terminate (wait-branch), (2) the branch that is not yet terminated is aborted (kill-branch), (3) the branch is not re-synchronized at all and continues in parallel (detached branch).</p>
						<p>A kill branch is only executed if there is at least one active wait (or exclusive wait) branch. If there is no other wait branch active, a kill branch is not started at all (rather than being aborted shortly after it is started.) Since a detached branch is unrelated to all other branches, active detached branches do not protect a kill-branch from being aborted.</p>

If XOR criteria occur together with OR and AND criteria, exactly one of the XOR criteria must be true, and at least one of the OR criteria and all AND criteria must be true. In other words, the sets of AND, OR, and XOR criteria are in turn combined by a logical AND operator (all AND criteria and at least one OR criterion and exactly one XOR criterion.)

						<p>This table includes codes for the Role class hierarchy.  The values in this hierarchy, represent a Role which is an association or relationship between two entities - the entity that plays the role and the entity that scopes the role.  Roles names are derived from the name of the playing entity in that role.</p>
						<p>The role hierarchy stems from three core concepts, or abstract domains:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									<b>RoleClassOntological</b> is an abstract domain that collects roles in which the playing entity is defined or specified by the scoping entity.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<b>RoleClassPartitive</b> collects roles in which the playing entity is in some sense a "part" of the scoping entity.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<b>RoleClassAssociative</b> collects all of the remaining forms of association between the playing entity and the scoping entity. This set of roles is further partitioned between:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p>
											<b>RoleClassPassive</b> which are roles in which the playing entity is used, known, treated, handled, built, or destroyed, etc. under the auspices of the scoping entity. The playing entity is passive in these roles in that the role exists without an agreement from the playing entity.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<b>RoleClassMutualRelationship</b> which are relationships based on mutual behavior of the two entities. The basis of these relationship may be formal agreements or they may be <i>de facto</i> behavior.  Thus, this sub-domain is further divided into:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<p>
													<b>RoleClassRelationshipFormal</b> in which the relationship is formally defined, frequently by a contract or agreement.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													<b>Personal relationship</b> which inks two people in a personal relationship. </p>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The hierarchy discussed above is represented In the current vocabulary tables as a set of abstract domains, with the exception of the  "Personal relationship" which is a leaf concept.</p>
