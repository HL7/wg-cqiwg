                        <p>Publication of this draft standard for trial use and comment has been
                            approved by Health Level Seven International (HL7). This draft standard
                            is not an accredited American National Standard. The comment period for
                            use of this draft standard shall end 24 months from the date of
                            publication. Suggestions for revision should be submitted at
                            http://www.hl7.org/dstucomments/index.cfm. Following this 24-month
                            evaluation period, this draft standard, revised as necessary, will be
                            submitted to a normative ballot in preparation for approval by ANSI as
                            an American National Standard. Implementations of this draft standard
                            shall be viable throughout the normative ballot process and for up to
                            six months after publication of the relevant normative standard.</p>

                        <p>The HL7 project to create electronic quality measure standards was
                            originally supported by volunteer efforts and through the National
                            Quality Forum's (NQF, <a href="http://www.qualityforum.org"
                                >www.qualityforum.org</a>) contract with the U.S. Department of
                            Health and Human Services to promote the effective use of Electronic
                            Health Record (EHR) systems. The Collaborative for Performance Measure
                            Integration with EHR Systems --co-sponsored by the American Medical
                            Association (AMA), the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA),
                            and the Electronic Heath Record Association (EHRA)--developed a Health
                            Quality Measure Format (HQMF) reference guide and a prototype to address
                            performance measure functionality and integration with EHR systems. The
                            HQMF prototype defined a standard for expressing performance measures
                            while preserving the clinical intent of the measure itself. In Spring
                            2009, NQF sponsored efforts to align the prototype HQMF and with HL7
                            constructs, resulting in the publication of the HL7 Version 3 Standard,
                            "Representation of the Health Quality Measures Format (eMeasure),
                            Release 1".</p>
                        <p> Release 2 (R2) and 2.1 (R2.1) updates were sponsored by the Office of 
                            Clinical Standards
                            and Quality of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in
                            partnership with HL7 and the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC).
                            The project is carried out within the framework of ONC's Standards and

                        <p><q>If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it.</q> -- Lord Kelvin
                            (1824-1907)</p>
                        <div hl7Id="uvqm_Over.1" title="What is the HQMF, and what is an eMeasure?">
                            <p>The Health Quality Measures Format (HQMF) is a standard for
                                representing a health quality measure as an electronic document. A
                                quality measure is a quantitative tool to assess the performance of
                                an individual or organization's performance in relation to a
                                specified process or outcome via the measurement of an action,
                                process, or outcome of clinical care. Quality measures are often
                                derived from clinical guidelines and are designed to determine
                                whether the appropriate care has been provided given a set of
                                clinical criteria and an evidence base. Quality measures are also
                                often referred to as performance measures or quality indicators.
                                Public health programs engage in quality measurement in the context
                                of monitoring and improving the health of the jurisdiction
                                population. Specific measures and other analytics are performed
                                within surveillance programs and are subject to correlation with
                                dynamic environmental factors, social conditions, and other
                                epidemiologic criteria that are not suited to static measure
                                definition. In support of these quality measurement activities,
                                cohort measures specify a population of interest to a given
                                surveillance program. Such cohort measures are intended to assess
                                and report records of interest to the surveillance program.</p>
                            <p>Through standardization of a measure's structure, metadata,
                                definitions, and logic, the HQMF provides measure consistency and
                                unambiguous interpretation. A health measure encoded in the HQMF is
                                referred to as an "eMeasure".</p>
                            <p>Standardization of document structure (e.g., sections), metadata
                                (e.g., author, verifier), and definitions (e.g., numerator, initial
                                population) enables a wide range of measures, currently existing in
                                a variety of formats, to achieve at least a minimal level of
                                consistency and readability, even if not fully machine processable. </p>
                            <p>Formal representation of the clinical, financial, and administrative
                                concepts and logic within an eMeasure supports unambiguous
                                interpretation and consistent reporting. Examples of statements that
                                can be formally represented by the HQMF are: </p>
                            <blockquote>

                                    days.</p>
                                <p>To be included in a public health reportable population, a

                                    requires reporting of Tuberculosis.</p>

                            <p>HQMF, like the HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) standard, is
                                derived from an overarching structured document architecture. HQMF
                                is not a CDA standard, but rather, has a peer-to-peer relationship
                                with CDA. In order to report the results of an HQMF computation,
                                systems typically will use the HL7 CDA R2 Quality Reporting Document
                                Architecture (QRDA) standard.</p>

                            <p>Creating eMeasures in HQMF requires measure developers to adopt a
                                programmer's mind-set. Constructing or creating eMeasures in HQMF is
                                similar to constructing an SQL query. HQMF is a declarative
                                programming language. As with any such language, it is possible to
                                create code that is syntactically correct but logically incorrect.
                                The result is unanticipated bugs or side effects. Therefore, while
                                creating eMeasures, measure developers must consider that each
                                eMeasure will be processed by an HQMF Release 2 (R2) processing
                                engine. A processing engine is a program that parses an HQMF file,
                                executes the logic against a data store, and computes results (i.e.,
                                7 patients in the Denominator, 3 in the Numerator). As HQMF
                                processing engines become more available, measure developers will
                                need to adopt many of the practices common to software development
                                such as integrating testing with the development process. Measure
                                developers can refer to HQMF processing engines that currently exist
                                (e.g., US ONC Query Health Initiative, MITRE Cypress project) to
                                better understand HQMF processing complexities. </p>

                                <p>Public health epidemiologists, often drawing upon available
                                    evidence, devise requirements for reporting from providers and
                                    laboratories to monitor community health. These reporting
                                    requirements are mapped to standard vocabularies and structures
                                    available to EHR systems, laboratory systems, and information
                                    exchanges, which are then expressible as a Cohort measure
                                    definition in HQMF (called an eMeasure). This eMeasure may be
                                    understood by providers to guide reportable actions for care,
                                    and to guide collection of Electronic Health Record (EHR),
                                    laboratory, and other source reporting data. These data are
                                    assembled into public health reports (e.g., HAI CDA Report, HL7
                                    CDA for public health reports) and submitted to public health
                                    authorities.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>Unambiguous expression of concepts and logic within an eMeasure is a
                                necessary step towards the larger objective of enabling a direct
                                query against an EHR or other operational data store. While HQMF is
                                not an EHR query language, through the provision of unambiguous and
                                formal definitions, it is an EHR query enabler. Additionally, an
                                unambiguous representation of the clinical concepts in an eMeasure
                                allows EHR vendors and healthcare providers to be proactive in
                                capturing such information at the point of care. If, for example, a
                                quality measure reports on the provision of educational material to
                                stroke patients, the corresponding eMeasure will make it clear
                                exactly what type of educational material would be considered
                                appropriate care. If the eMeasure calls for the collection of a
                                certain data element not normally captured by the EHR, the EHR might
                                now prompt the user to collect this information, thereby enhancing
                                both the quality of data reporting and the quality of care. These
                                data might similarly be captured through invoking a public health
                                reporting form that is pre-populated from the EHR data allowing for
                                the user to enter the remaining data attributes.</p>

                            <p>This HQMF Release 2.1 (R2.1) draft standard for trial use (DSTU) uses the

                                HQMF R2.1 from being compatible with HQMF Release 1. Backward and
                                forward compatibility can be handled via transforms. Prototype
                                transforms have already been developed and tested with significant
                                success, but complex HQMF R1 measures will require manual work for a
                                successful migration to HQMF R2.1.</p>

                        <p>An eMeasure document is wrapped by the &lt;QualityMeasureDocument&gt;
                            element, and contains a header and a body (see <a href="#uvqm_Model.1"
                                >QualityMeasureDocument</a>). The header identifies and classifies
                            the document and provides important metadata about the measure.</p>
                        <p>The body contains sections (&lt;populationCriteriaSection&gt;
                            &lt;dataCriteriaSection&gt;, etc.), each wrapped by the
                            &lt;component&gt; element. Each section can contain a single HQMF
                            narrative block (see the <a href="#uvqm_Model.6.4">Section Narrative
                                Block</a>), and any number of HQMF entries. An eMeasure conformant
                            to the specification may contain pre-defined components, such as the
                            Population Criteria Section (see <a href="#uvqm_Model.1.1">Document
                                constraints</a>). Each pre-defined component may suggest or require
                            various entries (see <a href="#uvqm_Model.6">Section Constraints</a>),
                            and HQMF entries within these components are constrained to better
                            ensure consistency across eMeasures (see <a href="#uvqm_Model.10">Entry
                                Constraints</a>). Additional components and entries, above and
                            beyond those required for HQMF conformance, can be included as
                            needed.</p>
                        <p>The HQMF narrative block must contain the human readable content to be
                            rendered. Within a component, the narrative block represents content to
                            be rendered whereas HQMF entries represent structured content provided
                            for further computer processing.</p>
                        <p>A minimally conformant eMeasure will contain elements from the document
                            header, but need not include computable Data Criteria. In this case, the
                            full narrative of the eMeasure, in any electronic format, is placed into
                            or referenced by QualityMeasureDocument.text. From there, one can
                            represent the full narrative of a quality measure within the narrative
                            blocks of HQMF defined components. Full encoding further enhances the
                            narrative of the quality measure with the addition of entries.</p>

                            <p>Every quality measure has a Measure Period. The Measure Period
                                designates the reference time frame for which data are identified,
                                filtered and analyzed. Measure Period can be expressed as both fixed
                                times (start and end date) and relative times (start date and a
                                period of reporting frequency). The exact usage of Measure Period
                                depends on the measure and its purpose. Data that are collected
                                before or after the Measure Period can also be identified with a
                                time relationship, explained in the next part of this document.</p>

                                <p>HQMF assumes that Data Criteria are evaluated in stages. For
                                    example a Data Criterion element (encounter) might include a
                                    constraint that a patient had an encounter within the measure
                                    period. When this Data Criterion element is evaluated, first a
                                    list of all encounters is retrieved. Then, those encounters not
                                    within the measure period are removed. If the resulting list of
                                    encounters is empty, then the criterion is not satisfied. If the
                                    list contains at least one encounter, then the criterion is
                                    satisfied. This document refers to that refinement process as
                                    "filtering" and the refinements applied to a data criterion
                                    during evaluation as "filters". The filters that can be applied
                                    to a Data Criterion element include <a href="#uvqm_Model.12.3.9"

                                <p>Quality measures often need to select patients based on

                                    of coded values are represented as value sets and are used to

                                <p>The HQMF standard allows Data Criteria to be referenced using the
                                    Data Criteria ID. This allows measure developers to create a
                                    Data Criteria definition once and reuse it multiple times
                                    throughout the measure document using the ID. Results compiled
                                    from evaluation of the original Data Criteria can be cached. The
                                    cached results can be reused, without reevaluation, whenever the
                                    Data Criteria ID is referenced. However, HQMF R2 does not
                                    mandate result caching (i.e., Data Criteria referenced via an ID
                                    can be reevaluated each time) and leaves this detail up to
                                    specific implementations of the standard.</p>

                                <p>In developing outcome measures, one challenge that measure
                                    developers often have is accounting for factors outside of
                                    provider or hospital control. These are features such as patient
                                    characteristics (age, health, etc.) or other risk factors.
                                    Because of variations in these risk factors, patients may
                                    experience variations in outcomes of care. Such variations in
                                    outcomes might not reflect the actual quality of care provided
                                    by the health care organization. Adjusting an outcome measure
                                    for these factors, a process called Risk Adjustment which
                                    produces a risk adjusted outcome measure, allows accurate
                                    comparison of outcomes across organizations. </p>
                                <p>Risk adjusted outcome measures identify risk factors as risk
                                    variables. Risk variables are plugged into a risk model to
                                    calculate the risk adjustment. In HQMF, risk variables are
                                    expressed in data criteria that extract the information needed
                                    for the risk model. </p>
                                <p>For example, a measure that calculates the risk-standardized
                                    mortality rate will identify risk variables such as patient age,
                                    first measurement of systolic blood pressure, first troponin
                                    level, and first creatinine level. Data criteria for the
                                    troponin and patient age risk variables are shown below:</p>

                                    <p>In a cohort measure, a population is identified from the
                                        population of all items being counted. For example, one
                                        might identify all the patients who have had H1N1 symptoms.
                                        The identified population is very similar to the Initial
                                        Population but is called a Cohort Population for public
                                        health purposes. In the Constrained Information Model (CIM),
                                        the population will be expressed using the
                                        InitialPopulationCriteria act. The Cohort Population result

                                    many patients met a particular criterion, the number of beds
                                    available for those patients, and the number of staff treating
                                    those patients. To express this, Items Counted (ITMCNT) is
                                    provided as a Measure Attribute so that a population
                                    can make explicit what is being counted.</p>

                            <p>Tying criteria acts to specific occurrences of events, such as
                                encounters, is an important part of quality measures. HQMF R2
                                provides a criteriaReference element to allow creation of
                                relationships between criteria acts. However, a criteria reference
                                ID refers to the entire group of acts returned by a criteria entry,
                                and not an individual act within it. This creates a subtle logical
                                problem when checking if certain criteria were satisfied as part of
                                a singular event. To ensure criteria are correctly checked as part
                                of a single event, measure authors must reference a single event
                                criteria in the population section. This can be done using one of
                                the following approaches (assume occurrence of encounter): </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Ensure all criteria for a particular encounter,including
                                    diagnosis, patient age, etc., are included as part of the same
                                    encounterCriteria using multiple outbound relationships or
                                    temporal relationships. In the population criteria section,
                                    refer to this "super" encounterCriteria using the
                                    criteriaReference ID.</li>
                                <li>(Recommended Approach) Write individual criteria and then "wrap"
                                    each in individual encounterCriteria by using temporal
                                    relationships or outbound relationships. Use grouperCriteria to
                                    intersect these criteria to ensure only encounters that satisfy
                                    all criteria are found. (This is the recommended approach.) In
                                    the population criteria section, refer to this grouperCriteria
                                    using the criteriaReference ID.</li>

                                                than 120 days") is an assertion that can be found to
                                                be true or false, when comparing against raw data
                                                (either QRDA documents or EHR data).Formally, Data
                                                Criteria return sets of matching data nodes which
                                                pass the assertions stated in the Data Criteria.
                                                Hence, an empty data set resolves to "false" , while
                                                a non-empty set resolves to "true". Filters can then
                                                be applied to a returned non-empty data set. Data
                                                Criteria in HQMF are used primarily to determine
                                                whether or not the item being counted (e.g.,
                                                patients, encounters, procedures, etc.) is included
                                                in a measure's Population, Numerator, Denominator,
                                                etc. For instance, a measure might say that "to be
                                                included in the Denominator, a patient must have age
                                                greater than 18 and antibiotic therapy prescribed".
                                                HQMF formalizes Data Criteria by expressing them as
                                                RIM patterns coupled with vocabularies. Where a
                                                patient or the item being counted has an object in
                                                EHR that is subsumed by Data Criteria, those
                                                criteria can be deemed true for that patient or item
                                                being counted. Most measures focus on counting the
                                                number of patients that meet certain Data Criteria.
                                                However, this may not always be the case. An example
                                                of a non-patient centric measure is NQF #0435, which
                                                counts encounters where Ischemic stroke patients
                                                were prescribed antithrombotic therapy at hospital
                                                discharge (the item being counted here would be
                                                encounters and not actual patients).</li>
                                            <li><b>Population Criteria are defined</b>: Criteria for
                                                Numerator, Denominator, and other measurement
                                                populations are defined based on the underlying Data
                                                Criteria. For instance, the criteria for a patient
                                                to be part of a measure's Denominator might be that
                                                the patient meets the criteria for "diminished renal
                                                capacity" and does not meet the criteria that
                                                "antibiotic was prescribed". Population Criteria,
                                                like Data Criteria, are assertions that can be found
                                                to be true or false, thereby providing a means for
                                                HQMF to formalize a measure's population
                                                parameters.</li>
                                            <li><b>Measure observations are defined</b>: While some
                                                quality measures only define Data Criteria and
                                                Population Criteria, other quality measures also
                                                define variables or calculations that are used to
                                                score a particular aspect of performance. For
                                                instance, a measure intends to assess the use of
                                                restraints. Population criteria for the measure
                                                include "patient is in a psychiatric inpatient
                                                setting" and "patient has been restrained". For this
                                                population, the measure defines a measure
                                                observation of "restraint time" as the total amount
                                                of time the patient has been restrained. Measure
                                                observations are not criteria, but rather, are
                                                definitions of observations, used to score a

                                <p>Terms like "numerator" and "denominator" can be ambiguous, in
                                    that they can refer to [1] the criteria for determining if an
                                    individual patient is included in a particular population (e.g.,
                                    "numerator criteria are inpatient AND diagnosis of pneumonia AND
                                    treated with antibiotic"); [2] the total count of patients
                                    meeting the criteria (e.g., "27 patients meet the numerator
                                    criteria"); [3] the top or bottom of a fraction (e.g., "the
                                    numerator is total restraint time, the denominator is total
                                    psychiatric inpatient days"). HQMF differentiates these
                                    interpretations in a number of ways:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Data criteria and population criteria are expressed as
                                        individual patient criteria. In other words, criteria are
                                        constructed such that one can determine whether or not a
                                        particular patient meets the criteria. </li>
                                    <li>HL7 has distinct codes to distinguish between the
                                        interpretations. For example, the code "included in
                                        denominator" is an assertion (represented in HQMF as an
                                        observation value) that a patient has met the denominator
                                        criteria; whereas the code "denominator count" is an
                                        observation (represented as an observation code) that
                                        carries a value. </li>
                                    <li>Measure Observations are not implicitly tied to any
                                        particular population and can explicitly reference the
                                        population over which they apply. For example, a measure
                                        defines a Measure Observation "average systolic blood
                                        pressure" as the sum of systolic blood pressures divided by
                                        the number of blood pressure readings. While the "sum of
                                        systolic blood pressures" is the numerator of an equation,
                                        it bears no relationship to the measure's numerator
                                        population. In fact, a quality organization may require that
                                        "average systolic blood pressure" be reported on any of the
                                        measure populations. Examples in Public Health Reporting

                                    collect data based on the same eMeasure, but stipulate different
                                    reporting requirements. For example, several organizations might
                                    be interested in the use of antibiotics in patients with
                                    bronchitis. An eMeasure could then define the nenominator
                                    criteria as "encounter with diagnosis of bronchitis", and the
                                    numerator criteria as "antibiotic prescription is written". One
                                    quality organization wishes to receive a quarterly summary where
                                    all qualifying encounters are reported, stratified by age;
                                    whereas another quality organization requests semi-annual
                                    reports, where, in order to minimize the human burden of chart
                                    review, only 20% of encounters with a diagnosis of bronchitis
                                    need to be sampled.</p>
                                <p>A "measure definition" includes those components of a quality

                                    and can vary across organizations. While the dividing line is
                                    not absolute, common reporting requirements that are not
                                    typically defined as part of an eMeasure include reporting

                                    criterion.</li>
                                <li>Unknown item data or missing data.</li>

                            <p>For result #1 or #2, it is straightforward to evaluate what
                                population group the item should belong to, based upon criterion
                                satisfaction.</p>
                            <p>For result #3, since HQMF measures normally do not provide guidance
                                on how to deal with the unknown result, there are often questions.
                                Does or does not the item being counted meet the criterion? How can
                                one determine a measure population group based on unknown result?
                                Should a query continue to retrieve other data for the item being
                                counted for the rest of the measure criteria?</p>
                            <p>To eliminate confusion and inconsistency in interpreting unknown data
                                or missing data, the following constraint will apply: if data are
                                unknown or missing, they SHALL fail the criteria unless otherwise
                                specified in the measure.</p>
                            <p>To specify criteria around missing data, a measure can include
                                missing data constructs using null flavors as part of the measure
                                definition itself. For more information on this topic, refer to <a

                            <p>While developing eMeasures, another aspect measure authors might need
                                to account for is corrupt or invalid data. For example, assuming
                                that one measure has a criterion of systolic blood pressure greater
                                than 130, invalid and obviously misreported values such as systolic
                                BP of 2000 might be reported as part of the criteria results. </p>
                            <p>For corrupt or invalid data, measure authors may need to take
                                additional steps to construct HQMF eMeasures in a way that either
                                reduces the chance of invalid values contaminating the result pool
                                or reports invalid/corrupt data values separately using stratifiers.
                                Although reporting invalid data is not explicitly defined in HQMF as
                                a separate section, there are several strategies to deal with the
                                situation.</p>
                            <p>One methodology is to define Data Criteria with caps at values deemed
                                appropriate for the measure, using the appropriate Boolean logic
                                (see the chapter on <a href="#uvqm_Model.26">Logical Groupers</a>)
                                to check for false criteria before including a result into the
                                result set. </p>
                            <p>A second approach is to use stratifiers (see the chapter on <a
                                    href="#uvqm_Model.24">StratifierCriteria</a>) to group the
                                outlier/corrupt data values separately so measure authors have an
                                idea if and when their Data Criteria are returning values that might
                                skew the results. This would require a measure developer to create
                                the Data Criteria needed to pick out only the outlier values and
                                then use the stratifier criteria entry to group these values
                                together. An important point to note is that this approach does not
                                remove these values from the overall result set as in the previous
                                approach. It only makes it easier for developers to identify that
                                such values exist in the data set.</p>

                                type) that will be bound to one or more coded elements. Concept
                                domains exist to constrain the intent of a coded element at a
                                universal level, while deferring the association of the element to a

                                localization. Thus, concept domains are independent of any specific

                                are the possible concept codes that can be carried in an eMeasure
                                within a coded data type. Different value sets can be associated

                            <p>The HL7 HQMF Model is a "Constrained Information Model" (CIM)
                                (previously known as a "Refined Message Information Model" (RMIM)),
                                derived from a broader "Domain Information Model" (DIM) (previously
                                known as a "Domain Message Information Model" (DMIM)).</p>
                            <p>HL7 specifications derived from the HL7 RIM use a process known as
                                "cloning" to refine domain specific models from the base HL7 RIM.
                                When a refined model uses a specialization of an HL7 RIM class, the
                                new class in the refined model is known as a clone of the HL7 RIM
                                class. These specializations may further constrain the base class,
                                for example, by specifying more restrictive attribute cardinality or
                                by further constraints on the allowed vocabulary values. Multiple
                                clones of a particular HL7 RIM class may appear in a refined model,
                                each representing a different specialization.</p>
                            <p>The HQMF Model is a technical diagrammatic representation of the HQMF
                                specification. It is presented using diagramming conventions and
                                notations that were developed by HL7 to represent the specific
                                semantic constructs contained in the critical, "backbone" classes of
                                the RIM. Although it could be represented in Unified Modeling
                                Language notation, as the RIM is, the HL7 notation provides more
                                details about the specific constraints and class clones being

                                subsequently the HQMF schema, is derived from the Model, the Model
                                serves as a good basis for describing the standard. The <a

                                have a Data Criteria Section. Constraints are used to define the
                                Data Criteria Section and to require that it be present in an
                                eMeasure, but those constraints do not preclude the inclusion of

                                can identify the corresponding XML elements and attributes. When the

                            <p>The QualityMeasureDocument class is the entry point into the HQMF
                                Model, and corresponds to the &lt;QualityMeasureDocument&gt; XML
                                element that is the root element of an eMeasure document. An
                                eMeasure document is logically broken up into a header and a
                                body.</p>
                            <p>Quality measures, taken as a whole, contain a wide breadth of
                                content. It may only require small portions of the RIM to encode the
                                commonly seen components in quality measures (e.g., diagnoses,
                                medications, lab results), whereas additional portions of the RIM
                                are required to meet the use cases addressed by quality measures as
                                a whole. For this reason, large portions of the RIM are available in
                                the HQMF model, where they can be used to encode quality measure
                                components.</p>
                            <p>The QualityMeasureDocument class inherits various attributes from the
                                InfrastructureRoot class of RIM, including templateId and typeId. In
                                the QualityMeasureDocument class these are represented as
                                QualityMeasureDocument.templateId and QualityMeasureDocument.typeId.
                                When QualityMeasureDocument.templateId is valued in an instance, it
                                signals the imposition of a set of template-defined constraints. In
                                addition, the templateId attribute is available in all other HQMF
                                classes, thus enabling the imposition of a set of template-defined
                                constraints at any level of granularity. The value of this attribute
                                provides a unique identifier for the template(s) in question.</p>
                            <p>A minimally conformant eMeasure will contain elements from the
                                document header, but need not include structured sections. In this

                                QualityMeasureDocument.text. However, a structured eMeasure will
                                contain at least one section (the PopulationCriteriaSection), and
                                may contain more.</p>

                                            can be represented using parentQualityMeasureDocument 
                                            regardless of whether the prior measure was in HQMF syntax 
                                            or not.</li>
                                        <li>XFRM – indicates that this measure is a transformation of 
                                            a prior document to HQMF syntax without replacing the 
                                            source document (i.e., both are clinically equivalent but 
                                            in separate syntaxes).</li>
                                        <li>COMP – indicates that this measure uses components of the 
                                            referenced document and that the two were developed 
                                            together.</li>
                                        <li>USE – indicates that this measure uses components of the 
                                            referenced document and that the two were developed 
                                            separately.</li>
                                        <li>DRIV – indicates that this measure was derived from the 
                                            referenced document.</li>
                                        <li>XCRPT – indicates that this measure excerpts the 
                                            referenced document.</li>

                                    <p>Note that it is virtually impossible to relate an eMeasure to
                                        its paper-based sibling without specific implementation and
                                        program guidance. This is because a paper-based measure does
                                        not typically have a unique identifier that points
                                        specifically to it. For example, any given measure may be
                                        used in multiple clinical quality programs and be subtly
                                        different across those programs. Moreover, even within a
                                        single clinical quality program, there may be multiple
                                        versions of the same measure. In the event that an eMeasure
                                        needs to refer to its paper-based sibling, the
                                        recommendation is to handle it through an implementation
                                        guide that spells out the use of the

                                    <p>The Measure Period for a quality measure designates the
                                        reference time frame based on which data are identified,
                                        filtered, and analyzed. Measures are often designed to be
                                        used for a particular time period, such as one quarter or
                                        one year (e.g., Jan 1, 2013 to Dec 31, 2013). Measure Period
                                        is not the same as the reporting period for a measure which
                                        may be different for different organizations. For example a
                                        measure having a measure period of one year may have a
                                        quarterly reporting period.</p>
                                    <p>Measure Period is specified as a control variable for the
                                        measure, because it controls how the measure is computed. A
                                        localVariableName may be supplied for this control variable
                                        so that it can be referenced in computations elsewhere in
                                        the measure.</p>
                                    <p>At present, MeasurePeriod is the only control variable
                                        associated with measures. In the future, additional control
                                        variables may be specified, similar to how measure
                                        attributes are specified in the section following.</p>

                                measure sets other than those declared in the measure itself.
                                Typically this occurs because a measure set could be defined after a

                            <p>Represents the definitions of the value sets used within a measure.
                                Systems implementing a measure have the definitions or expansions of
                                value sets provided during the measure computation. This class
                                allows representations of a value set definition or expansion to be
                                provided. A value set definition explains how the set of codes in a
                                value set is obtained (e.g., retrieve from a specific terminology
                                service, such as PHIN-VADS in the U.S., etc.), while the expansion
                                provides the full set of codes. This specification does not define a
                                representation for definitions or expansions.</p>
                            <p>Here is an example using the valueSet element to define value sets
                                inline:</p>

                                <p>Elements conforming to the Concept Descriptor data type (such as
                                    observationCriteria/code) may contain a valueSet attribute that
                                    holds the OID or UUID for the value set. The valueSetVersion
                                    attribute can hold a time stamp with the date of the value set.
                                    The HL7 Vocabulary Work Group has rules for value set versioning
                                    that define when value set identifiers need to change. Measure
                                    developers should refer to those rules when creating or
                                    modifying value sets.</p>
                                <p>Value sets can be reused across many measures. For this to
                                    happen, value sets need a "steward", i.e., an organization that
                                    takes responsibility for maintaining the value set.
                                    Recommendations for specific tools for value set management are
                                    beyond the scope of this specification, but we recommend that
                                    such tools have the ability to associate a value set identifier
                                    with a steward.</p>

                                    Labeling). The schema is registered as a MIME type

                                    available for use in an eMeasure, many were added to meet the

                                        bullets, whereas ordered lists are typically rendered with
                                        numbers, although this is not a requirement.</p>

                                    <p>Receivers are required to interpret a footnote when rendering
                                        by visually distinguishing footnoted text. The exact
                                        rendition is at the discretion of the recipient, and might
                                        include a mark at the location of the footnote with a
                                        hyperlink to the footnoted text, a simple demarcation (such
                                        as "This is the text [this is the footnote] that is being
                                        footnoted"), etc.</p>
                                    <p>The &lt;footnoteRef&gt; element can reference an existing

                                        same document. It can be used when the same footnote is
                                        being used multiple times. The value of the
                                        footnoteRef.IDREF must be a footnote.ID value in the same

                                    <p>The &lt;content&gt; element is used to wrap a string of text
                                        so that it can be explicitly referenced, or so that it can
                                        suggest rendering characteristics. The &lt;content&gt;
                                        element can nest recursively, which enables wrapping a
                                        string of plain text down to as small a chunk as desired.
                                        The &lt;content&gt; element contains an optional identifier
                                        that can serve as the target of a reference. All values of
                                        attributes of type XML ID must be unique within the document
                                        (per theW3C XML specification).</p>
                                    <p>The &lt;content&gt; element contains an optional
                                        &quot;revised&quot; attribute that can be valued with
                                        &quot;insert&quot; or &quot;delete&quot;, which can be used
                                        to indicate narrative changes from the last version of a
                                        document. The attribute is limited to a single generation,
                                        in that it only reflects the changes from the preceding
                                        version of a document. If applied, it must be used in
                                        conjunction with standard document revision tracking.
                                        Changes to a document that has been released for use still
                                        require a formal versioning and revision, and the revised
                                        document can optionally carry the &quot;revised&quot;
                                        attribute to show the changes in the narrative. Receivers
                                        are required to interpret the &quot;revised&quot; attribute
                                        when rendering by visually distinguishing or suppressing
                                        deleted narrative.</p>

                                        lower case A-Z, remaining characters are any combination of
                                        upper and lower case letters or numbers).</p>
                                    <p>The styleCode attribute can contain multiple values,

                                        containing a styleCode attribute, the style effects are
                                        additive, as in the following example:</p>
                                    <pre style="&exampleStyle;">

       &lt;content styleCode=&quot;Bold Italics&quot;&gt;This is also rendered bold 
       and italicized.
    &lt;/content&gt;

                                        tag. It can be used to reference identifiers that are either

                                    <p>Multimedia that is integral to, and part of the verified

                                        &lt;renderMultimedia&gt; element described below. Multimedia
                                        that is simply referenced by the document and not an
                                        integral part of the document can use the &lt;linkHtml&gt;
                                        element.</p>
                                    <p>The source of a link uses the linkHtml.href attribute. The
                                        target of an internal reference is an identifier of type XML
                                        ID, which can exist for other elements in the same or a
                                        different narrative block, or Act.id identifiers.</p>
                                    <p>The linkHtml.name attribute is deprecated, because attributes
                                        of type XML ID provide an alternative and more consistent
                                        target for referencing. Following the conventions of HTML,
                                        an internal link is prefaced with the pound sign.</p>
                                    <p>Document links do not convey shareable meaning. Shareable
                                        semantics are only achieved by the inclusion of entries and
                                        their associated formalized relationships. There is no
                                        requirement that a receiver render an internal or external
                                        link, or the target of an external link.</p>

                                        attribute (of type XML IDREFS), the values of which must

                                        The expected behavior is that the referenced multimedia
                                        should be rendered or referenced at the point of reference.
                                        Where a caption is present, it must also be rendered. If the

                                        observation class, that observation class should be rendered

                            <p>The Population Criteria Section is used to formalize a measure's
                                population types (e.g., Initial Population, Numerator, Denominator).
                                Refer to the <a href="#uvqm_Concepts.3">Population Criteria
                                    Section</a>) provided earlier on what population types are

                            <p>Each population type within the Population Criteria Section combines
                                entries from the Data Criteria Section through logical ANDs/ORs to
                                identify the items to be counted or computed by the measure. Entries
                                in the Population Criteria Section, like entries in the Data

                            <p>Some things to note about the example:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The criteriaReference points to a Data Criteria element that
                                    defines inclusion criteria for a single patient, i.e., it is
                                    providing the criteria for determining whether or not a single
                                    patient meets the Initial Population criteria. A separate
                                    observation could be used to represent the total count of those
                                    patients meeting the criteria.</li>
                                <li>The sourceOf.typeCode "PRCN" (precondition) defines the criteria
                                    that must hold in order to satisfy inclusion. The target of the
                                    precondition can be a reference to a criterion defined
                                    elsewhere, whether in the same eMeasure document or contained in
                                    an external library of criteria, if necessary.</li>
                                <li>We can see from the above example, that the precondition element
                                    within an initialPopulationCriteria element does not explicitly
                                    mention any of the logical groupers "AllTrue", "AllFalse",
                                    "AtLeastOneTrue", etc. This is because the
                                    initialPopulationCriteria, numeratorCriteria,
                                    denominatorCriteria, and MeasurePopulationCriteria all have a
                                    default precondition of AllTrue within the
                                    populationCriteriaSection. Similarly NumeratorExclusionCriteria,
                                    DenominatorExclusionCriteria, DenominatorExceptionCriteria, and
                                    MeasurePopulationExlusionCriteria have a default precondition of
                                    AtLeastOneTrue.</li>

                                <p>It is very common to AND preconditions within the
                                    InitialPopulationCriteria. For instance, the example above
                                    requires that the patient's weight be measured and that the
                                    patient be 2 - 6 months old (i.e., allTrue). Since it is very
                                    common to AND preconditions, the fixed behavior for any
                                    preconditions appearing directly under the
                                    InitialPopulationCriteria is allTrue. (Note that this is also
                                    true for Numerators, Denominators and other populations as
                                    well). Therefore, the example above can be rewritten as
                                    follows:</p>

   &lt;/precondition&gt;
 &lt;/initialPopulationCriteria&gt;
 </pre>
                                <p>The next example defines the criteria for inclusion in a
                                    measure's Denominator as a combination of three criteria, joined
                                    by "AllTrue" and "AllFalse". While there are many ways to
                                    represent "AND NOT" in the HL7 RIM, the HQMF specification
                                    limits expression using the groupers described above. One cannot
                                    use negation indicators on reference criteria, although it is
                                    legal to negate the original criteria but not the reference. If
                                    negation of reference criteria were allowed, it would violate
                                    the notion that a data element that does not match Data Criteria
                                    specified by the measure is not relevant to the measure.</p>

                                <p>The example represents "to be included in the Numerator
                                    population, a patient must meet the Denominator criteria AND
                                    must have a problem list entry of atrial fibrillation". The fact
                                    that the patient must meet the Denominator criteria is
                                    explicitly stated (using the subject relationship), but
                                    depending on the measure, it may not be necessary.</p>
                                <p>When developing entries in the Population Criteria Section, it is
                                    essential to understand and be able to express clearly the
                                    underlying logic and criteria of the measure or public health
                                    reporting requirement(s). An ambiguous measure, with fuzzy
                                    inclusion criteria, will not become computable simply through
                                    its representation as an eMeasure. For instance, if a measure's
                                    Numerator inclusion criteria is "ambulatory visit" and "age 2 to
                                    6 months at the visit" and "weight measurement at the visit", it
                                    is important to understand that satisfying the criteria requires
                                    that there be at least one visit such that it is ambulatory AND
                                    age 2-6 months at visit AND weight measurement at visit. It
                                    would be incorrect to identify a patient that had two ambulatory
                                    visits during the Measure Period, the first when 5 months old
                                    with no weight measurement, the second when 7 months old with
                                    weight measurement.</p>
                                <p>The next example correctly defines the Numerator criteria in the
                                    above scenario, by expressing the age and weight measurement
                                    criteria as components of the ambulatory encounter criterion.
                                    (The same can be done, albeit verbosely, by defining two
                                    encounterCriteria and then intersecting them using

                                eMeasure.</p>
                            <p>The HQMF format enables eMeasures to be written against the HL7 RIM
                                as the basis for describing the measure definition. An eMeasure may
                                also be designed to operate against a particular implementation data
                                model (e.g., the HL7 Virtual Medical Record, or the HL7 CCD). The
                                Model Definition element allows an eMeasure to associate measure
                                criteria with data model elements. These data model elements must be
                                uniquely identified in the measure. The definition relationship
                                allows the identifiers for these model elements to be specified.</p>
                            <p> This relationship provides a choice box containing data element
                                types for acts, encounters, observations, procedures, substance
                                administration, and supply acts. They all support the same
                                attributes as ActDefinition described below. The eMeasure need not
                                specify the implementation data model specification. It only needs
                                to uniquely associate the referenced data model elements and type
                                information with a data criterion. This enables translation of the
                                measure into a computable form.</p>

                            <p>The RIM, like many other healthcare data models, is a service-centric
                                model, meaning that much of health care is seen as comprised of a
                                number of health care services or "acts". At the heart of the HL7
                                RIM is the Act class. Acts include such things as observations
                                (blood pressure, lab result, infection type), procedures
                                (appendectomy, caesarian section, central line insertion),
                                encounters (office visit, hospitalization), etc. An act is "a record
                                of something that is being done, has been done, can be done, or is
                                intended or requested to be done". Thus, the RIM allows for not only
                                the representation of acts that have occurred, but that may occur.
                                It also allows acts to serve as criteria for rules or guidelines or
                                quality measures, should they occur. This latter feature, the
                                ability to express an act as a criterion, is heavily exploited in
                                the formal representation of quality measure statements in the Data
                                Criteria section.</p>
                            <p>From an implementation perspective, the RIM's Act class contains an
                                attribute "isCriterionInd", which when true is used to indicate that
                                the Act serves as a description of an act that may have
                                occurred.</p>
                            <p> Note: The default behavior for a criterion is to serve as a
                                description. However, some cases may require more complex logic. In
                                these situations, an expression language may be used to express the
                                desired result. If all else fails, HQMF processing engines may need
                                to use template IDs to trigger special use cases which cannot be
                                handled by any other means. </p>
                            <p>The following example, a valid entry in the Data Element section,
                                represents the criterion for a completed weight observation:</p>
                            <pre style="&exampleStyle;">
&lt;observationCriteria classCode="OBS" moodCode="EVN" isCriterionInd="true"&gt;
   &lt;id root=&quot;f92aa450-73c0-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;code code=&quot;27113001&quot; codeSystem=&quot;2.16.840.1.113883.6.96&quot;
      codeSystemName=&quot;SNOMED CT&quot;&gt; &lt;displayName value=&quot;weight&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/code&gt;
   &lt;statusCode code=&quot;completed&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/observationCriteria&gt;
</pre>
                            <p>Some things to note about the example:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The observation.id uniquely identifies this criterion assertion,
                                    allowing it to be referenced by other criteria. The ability to
                                    uniquely identify and reference a criterion enables an external
                                    library of criteria, and enables the construction of more
                                    modular criteria, which is further exploited in the Population
                                    Criteria section (e.g., when defining Numerator criteria). (An
                                    observation.id is a globally unique object identifier. Details
                                    of the Instance Identifier (II) data type can be found in the
                                    Data Types R2 specification.) </li>
                                <li>Whereas observation.id uniquely identifies this criterion, all
                                    other properties of the criterion, such as observation.code and
                                    observation.value, express patterns that are to be met by an EHR
                                    object meeting the criterion. In reality, an EHR would not
                                    necessarily search for an exact match, but rather, for objects
                                    that are subsumed by the criteria. For instance, if the EHR is
                                    using a local code that maps to the criterion's weight
                                    measurement code, the EHR object would still meet the
                                    criterion.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In a data criterion, if a measure parameter's value must be one of a
                                list of allowable codes, the eMeasure steward would be expected to
                                provide access to the actual value set (e.g., via a web site where
                                the value set definiton can be found). The following example
                                represents the criterion that encounter code be one of a list of
                                allowable codes:</p>
                            <pre style="&exampleStyle;">

&lt;/encounterCriteria&gt;
</pre>
                            <p>Some things to note about the example:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>In this example, an external body, the National Quality Forum
                                    (NQF), has developed a value set of encounter codes. The NQF
                                    manages and versions this value set, and the value set is used
                                    in the construction of a number of other criteria. Code.valueSet
                                    contains the identifier for this value set. An actual encounter
                                    event with a code from this value set (or with a local code
                                    mapped to a member of the value set) would be subsumed by this
                                    criterion. </li>
                                <li>The example contains a reference to a value set. The eMeasure
                                    steward would be expected to provide access to the actual value
                                    set (e.g., via a web site). </li>
                                <li>Code.valueSetVersion can be used where it is necessary to
                                    associate an eMeasure with a particular version of allowable
                                    codes.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Quality measure criteria commonly apply to age, or to a defined

                                    <p>The excerpt relationship allows one of a set of similar acts
                                        to be considered in a criterion, e.g., the first, last, or
                                        most recent act of a series of similar acts.</p>
                                    <p>The excerpt relationship is used to extract (excerpt) a
                                        subset of acts from a set of similar acts matching a
                                        criterion, or to summarize the set of acts. An example of
                                        using excerpt is discussed in the chapter <a
                                            href="#uvqm_Concepts.2.4">Processing Order and Data
                                            Criteria.</a></p>
                                    <p>It is important to note that, even though the CIM allows it,
                                        an excerpt cannot contain a different criteria type from the
                                        outer criteria since that would not make semantic sense. The
                                        criteria element type inside an excerpt shall match the
                                        outer criteria element type (e.g., both the source and
                                        target elements are observationCriteria) and it is
                                        excerpting the events that are returned based on the outer
                                        criteria. </p>
                                    <p>Note: When excerpting, be aware of subtle differences in
                                        criteria. The following two specifications do not result in
                                        the same outcome:</p>

                                        the first criterion. However, he does qualify under the
                                        second criterion because he has two results, one of which is

                                        applied to. However, here the intent is the opposite, i.e.,
                                        the excerpt operation is applied to the source act. Without
                                        inverting the relationship, the XML would need to be written
                                        in the reverse of this "natural" order. When the operation
                                        is inverted, the XML reads naturally.</p>

                                    <p>This attribute can be used to select a specific occurrence of
                                        an act by its sequence in time or an observation by its
                                        sorted value. By default, acts are assumed to be ordered
                                        from oldest to youngest. Setting sequenceNumber to 1 selects
                                        the oldest act. Setting the sequence number to 2 selects the
                                        second oldest act, etc. When used in combination with
                                        subsetCode, the sequenceNumber attribute allows one to
                                        select the second, third or Nth occurrence of the act, as
                                        ordered and selected according to the subsetCode. When
                                        sequenceNumber is not set, it assumed to be one.</p>
                                    <p>When used with target acts that are observationCriteria, acts
                                        can also be selected according to observationCriteria.value.
                                        To select the second highest value, set sequenceNumber to 2
                                        and subsetCode to MAX. To select the second lowest value,
                                        set sequenceNumber to 2 and subsetCode to MIN.</p>

                                    <p>This is used to indicate how the target of the relationship
                                        will be a filtered subset of the total related set of
                                        targets. It is used when there is a need to limit the number
                                        of components to the first, the last, the next, the total,
                                        the average, or some other filtered or calculated subset.
                                        When subsetCode is combined with sequenceNumber, the two
                                        constraints are additive. Thus, you could select the 4th
                                        largest value by setting subsetCode to MAX, and
                                        sequenceNumber to 4.</p>
                                    <p>When used with the subsetCode values for Summaries, the "act"
                                        being selected summarizes all of the acts. Time intervals
                                        (e.g., effectiveTime, availabilityTime) in the summarized
                                        acts become the smallest time range that spans the time
                                        interval of all summarized acts. The repeatNumber attribute
                                        of the act becomes the total number of acts summarized. The
                                        value of an observation becomes the sum of all observed
                                        values (assuming that values are stored using the physical
                                        quantity).</p>

                                    <p>When comparing two acts by time, there are occasions when it
                                        is important to determine if the times are within some
                                        number of hours or days of each other. The following example
                                        determines whether a medication administration occurred
                                        within 4 hours after a heart attack.</p>

                                        semantics for comparisons. For example, the precision of the
                                        timestamp "20130701" is only to the day, and actually
                                        represents the interval from [201307010000, 201307020000),
                                        i.e. it is the interval from the first moment of July 1 2013
                                        through the last moment before July 2, 2013. Thus it is
                                        semantically invalid to assume a timestamp that is not
                                        specified to full precision is the same as one that is (i.e.
                                        20130701 is not equal to 201307010000, just as it is not
                                        equal to 201307012233). </p>
                                    <p>The following table illustrates common meanings of the
                                        temporal relationships used together with pauseQuantity.
                                        Implicit in the understanding of the table is that whenever
                                        a temporal comparison is performed, it is made between the
                                        source act's effectiveTime and the target act's
                                        effectiveTime. The proper endpoint for comparison of each
                                        effectiveTime is determined by the temporal comparison
                                        operator. For example, for SBS (Starts Before Start),
                                        because the starting time of each act is compared, the
                                        relevant endpoint for each act's effectiveTime is
                                        effectiveTime.low. Similarly, for SAS, effectiveTime.low is
                                        used. If a comparison such as SBE (Starts Before End) is
                                        used, the proper endpoints for comparison are
                                        effectiveTime.low and effectiveTime.high, respectively.
                                        Because the table would be largely duplicative for many of
                                        the temporal relationships involving inequalities, only SBS
                                        and SAS are shown. All others can be derived by substituting
                                        use of the proper effectiveTime endpoints. </p>
                                    <p> Please note that the temporal relationships that are
                                        equality (not inequality) relationships, such as SCW (Starts
                                        Concurrent With), can be used with proper endpoints to
                                        implement all of the other temporal relationships, and
                                        additionally can add closed endpoint semantics. See note (2)
                                        below. </p>
                                    <p> Since the literal interpretation of
                                        Act1--AR.pauseQuantity(x)--Act2 is "Act1" paused by "x"
                                        "Relationship R" "Act2", this means that using an
                                        URG&lt;PQ&gt; as pauseQuantity is identical to saying "Act1"
                                        R "Act2" where "Act1" is paused by some quantity (expressed
                                        by the width of the uncertain range, computed by the actual
                                        endpoints of the uncertain range). The width attribute is
                                        disallowed in the expression of URG&lt;PQ&gt;. </p>
                                    <p> An URG&lt;PQ&gt; represents inexactness (uncertainty) as to
                                        the actual pauseQuantity, which is defined to be some point
                                        between the endpoints of the URG. </p>
                                    <p> In the case where R expresses an inequality (such as SBS)
                                        the use of an URG&lt;PQ&gt; is discouraged in favor of a PQ,
                                        as the use of an URG&lt;PQ&gt; to represent the
                                        pauseQuantity usually does not provide any more information
                                        than using a PQ that expresses the limiting endpoint. For
                                        example, A SBS (+2 hours, +3 hours) B expresses the same
                                        information as A SBS +2 Hours B. This is because all points
                                        occurring within the URG are satisfied by the single PQ.
                                        Similarly, the URG (+2 hours, PINF) is no more expressive.
                                        The URG notation can be used for the case where the intent
                                        is to incorporate a closed endpoint, rather than open
                                        endpoint expressed by a PQ. </p>
                                    <p> Example: </p>
                                    <p> A SBS +1 H B means "A.start paused by 1 hour is less than
                                        B.start" and is true for all A &lt; B-1 H </p>
                                    <p>Similarly, A SBS (+1H, +3H) B means "A.start paused by some
                                        quantity between 1 hour and 3 hours is less than B.start"
                                        and is subsumed by A &lt; B – 1 H. </p>

                                        <li>Actual clinical situations typically require some
                                            degree of uncertainty when temporally comparing
                                            activities. For example, criteria for an eMeasure
                                            that expresses "Aspirin prescribed (Act 1) at time
                                            of (concurrent with) Inpatient Discharge (Act 2)"
                                            might be Act1.effectiveTime.low SCW
                                            Act2.effectiveTime.low. The intent of the measure
                                            may be that the criteria are true if the two acts
                                            occurred at the same time within some small
                                            tolerance, which may be incorrectly captured by
                                            comparisons of exact timestamps. An URG&lt;PQ&gt;
                                            with a width of the uncertainty range may be used in

                                            interpretation of that uncertainty. This example

                                        <p>The outboundRelationship allows use of the broad set of
                                            RIM-based relationships between acts not otherwise
                                            specified above. In HQMF outboundRelationship should be
                                            used to relate non-temporally related acts. Measure
                                            Developers should use the temporallyRelatedInformation
                                            act relationship to specify related acts in most cases
                                            and use outboundRelationship where the acts have to be
                                            related without any temporal relations.
                                            OutboundRelationship is very similar to entry
                                            relationship in CDA and QRDA. Measure developers should
                                            use local best practices. (For example, in the United
                                            States, they should use the QDM-based HQMF
                                            Implementation Guide to constrain these broad RIM-based
                                            non-temporal relationships.)</p>
                                        <p>Similar to temporallyRelatedInformation and excerpts,
                                            outboundRelationship should only contain
                                            criteriaReferences and not define new criteria as part
                                            of the outboundRelationship.</p>

                            <p>GrouperCriteria is used when there is a need to combine the events
                                yielded by multiple Data Criteria into a single logical set. This is
                                useful for expressing criteria such as A DURING (B OR C OR D). A
                                single GrouperCriteria will be used to perform either Unions or
                                Intersections but not both.</p>
                            <p>Union and Intersection operations are represented using the
                                grouperCriteria.outboundRelationship.conjunctionCode attribute. The
                                conjunctionCode attribute is set to either "AND" for intersections,
                                or "OR" for unions. Each outboundRelationship within a
                                GrouperCriteria refers to other existing criteria. All
                                outboundRelationships within a GrouperCriteria SHALL have the same
                                conjunctionCode of either "AND" or "OR" depending on whether a union
                                or intersection operation is desired.</p>
                            <p>GrouperCriteria also provides a way to refer to specific occurrences
                                of events (encounters, procedures etc.) in quality measures.
                                GrouperCriteria is used to combine criteria and to tie them to
                                specific occurrences of events. A generic example is shown below,
                                followed by an example derived from a real-world measure. </p>

                            <p>For further illustration, let us examine NQF Measure 70. The
                                Denominator criteria are the set of encounters in which left
                                ventricular systolic dysfunction is diagnosed, minus some exclusions
                                (criterion LVSD). The Numerator states that a beta blocker must be
                                ordered during that same occurrence of such an encounter (criterion
                                BetaBlocker). There are two tempting but incorrect ways to write
                                this:</p>
                            <ol>

                                <li>Put BetaBlocker and LVSD inside an allTrue block in the
                                    numerator. Unfortunately, because the measure is counting
                                    patients, the measure would count all patients who match both
                                    BetaBlocker and LVSD, regardless of whether the beta blocker was
                                    administered during the encounter in which LVSD was
                                    diagnosed.</li>
                                <li>Use a temporallyRelatedInformation block in BetaBlocker to
                                    relate it to the LVSD criterion. The error here is more subtle.
                                    This solution specializes beta-blocker administration events,
                                    not LVSD events. Although in the example this strategy works, if
                                    multiple such specializations occur in the Numerator, the
                                    Numerator would not accurately specialize the encounter set.
                                    Specifically, patients would be counted who meet LVSD and have
                                    at least one encounter with each specialization. If the intent
                                    is that all specializations occur in the same encounter, this
                                    approach fails.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>For this case, then, we must use a GrouperCriteria to perform Boolean

                                the empty set. The other use of a Grouper is to specialize temporal
                                relationships. For example, if we want to know whether a beta
                                blocker was administered during either an LVSD encounter or a
                                heart-surgery procedure, we would use a GrouperCriteria as
                                follows:</p>

                            <p>Some uses of HQMF may only require an IPPOP to be defined where all
                                patients identified in the IPPOP would be sent to the receiver using
                                the associated Quality Report Format (QRDA Category I or other
                                reporting format as required by the receiver). Allowing this
                                supports registries (such as CDC's cancer registry defined in an IHE
                                profile) and other similar types of data requests where the receiver
                                performs all of the analysis. HQMF defines the Population Criteria
                                and Data Criteria, whereas Quality Report Format determines the data
                                reporting architecture. The base recommendation is to send all the
                                patient records meeting the initial population by default within the
                                Quality Report Format (e.g., QRDA) framework. The receiver of
                                quality data will calculate the categorization of Denominator,
                                Numerator, and Denominator Exclusions for each patient record (in
                                the example of a proportion measure) according to the corresponding
                                HQMF specification where applicable, or for cohort measures, will
                                further analyze the data through locally defined assessments. It is
                                good practice to specify the Initial Population at the finest level
                                possible, with the goal reducing unnecessary data transmission.</p>

                                measure. This entry describes a set of criteria used to stratify the
                                results for a measure. Each precondition in a stratifierCriteria
                                represents one of the strata by which results will be segregated.
                                Strata are usually simple, based on patient demographics, but can
                                use more complicated logic as well. Multiple stratifierCriteria can
                                be present to stratify measure results in the same axis (e.g.,
                                stratum 1 ages 0-5 years, stratum 2 ages 5-18 years, stratum 3 ages
                                0-18 years) or by more than one axis. When multiple
                                StratifierCriteria exist, they are not combined. For example, if two
                                stratifierCriteria elements are present, one stratifying by age
                                group (e.g., &lt; 50 and &gt;= 50) and the other by gender, the
                                measure results are not stratified by the cross-product of the
                                criteria (i.e., the measure result will not be stratified such that
                                one can review results grouped by women &gt;= 50 years of age, or
                                men &lt; 50 years of age, etc.). To ensure that results are
                                stratified across these groupings (the cross-product of gender and
                                age, for example), a single stratifierCriteria would need to be

                                    purposes of data aggregation. Comparison of results across
                                    strata can be used to show where disparities exist or where
                                    there is a need to expose differences in results. Examples of

                            <p>While some quality measures only define Data Criteria and Population
                                Criteria, other quality measures, such as continuous variable
                                measures, also define variables or calculations that are used to
                                score a particular aspect of performance. For instance, a measure
                                intends to assess the use of restraints. Population criteria for the
                                measure include "patient is in a psychiatric inpatient setting" and
                                "patient has been restrained". For this population, the measure
                                defines a measure observation of "restraint time" as the total
                                amount of time the patient has been restrained. Measure observations
                                are not criteria, but rather, are definitions of observations, used
                                to score a measure. </p>
                            <p>For each item matching a measurePopulationCriteria, the calculation
                                specified in the measureObservationDefinition.value element is
                                performed. The result of this calculation is aggregated according to
                                the aggregation methods indicated in the methodCode
                                attribute(s).</p>
                            <p>Functionally, the score is computed as follows:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>For each measure observation definition, extract the different
                                    acts that are referenced by the value.expression element. The
                                    value.expression element uses the localVariableName element of
                                    the Data Criteria to help processing engines determine which
                                    acts must be extracted. The extracted acts will form a tuple (an
                                    ordered list of elements) so that necessary computations can be
                                    applied.</li>
                                <li>For each tuple, compute the value described by the
                                    value.expression element. </li>

                                observations in this Section are definitions (i.e., have
                                moodCode="DEF"). Measure observations are not criteria that can be
                                found to be true or false, but rather, are definitions of
                                observations, used to score a measure.</p>

                            <p>The measureObservationDefiniton.value.expression is a character

                                        an encounter whose codes come from a value set (the <em>ED
                                            Encounter Value Set</em>) identifying emergency

                                        arrival time. This measure will report the number of
                                        encounters, the average and median wait times, the standard
                                        deviation of the wait time, and the minimum and maximum wait

                                &lt;width&gt;. The HL7 Data Types R2 specification contains

                        <p>This appendix describes the changes made between versions of HQMF.</p>
                        <div title="HQMF R2 Changes">
                            <p>Release 2 (R2) improves upon the original HQMF Release 1
                                documentation by ensuring that the standards are computable, are easily
                                understood, and have robust reference implementation that showcases how
                                the standard can be used in the real world. Here is an overview of
                                changes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A new <a href="#uvqm_Over.2">Guidance for Measure Developers</a>
                                    segment encourages measure developers to use a programming mindset
                                    when constructing measure logic. Creating eMeasures in HQMF is
                                    similar to constructing queries in other programming languages.
                                    Therefore, it is possible to construct syntactically correct queries
                                    that contain unanticipated bugs or lead to unintended
                                    consequences.</li>
                                <li>A new <a href="#uvqm_Over.4">HQMF and Templated CDA</a> segment
                                    provides direction on how to tie HL7 Quality Reporting Document
                                    Architecture (QRDA) CDA templates to HQMF templates.</li>
                                <li>A new <a href="#uvqm_Over.5">Backwards Compatibility</a> segment
                                    gives insight on conversion of HQMF Release 1 to HQMF Release 2
                                    files.</li>
                                <li>The <a href="#uvqm_Over.6">General HQMF Concepts</a> segment
                                    contains new terminology (e.g., measure period), redefines and gives
                                    further information on existing sections (e.g., Data Criteria,
                                    Population Criteria), and instructs users on new sections (e.g.,
                                    stratifier criteria). Many of the concepts introduced in this
                                    segment are detailed throughout the rest of the document.</li>
                                <li>The <a href="#uvqm_Model">HQMF Model</a> segment has been revised.
                                    This chapter contains information on an improved Constrained
                                    Information Model (CIM). The CIM contains existing, new or revised
                                    attributes. Existing attributes are carried over from HQMF Release
                                    1. New attributes are added to address usability concerns. Certain
                                    attribute names and/or descriptions have been revised to better
                                    reflect their intent. Further information is provided about the use
                                    of value sets, their identification, versioning, stewardship and
                                    relationships.</li>
                                <li>The <a href="#uvqm_Model.6">Section</a> segment provides information
                                    about new sections within the body of the HQMF document (e.g.,
                                    Measure Description), further details the use of existing sections
                                    discussed earlier in the document (e.g., Data Criteria, Population
                                    Criteria, Measure Observations), and clarifies the use of the new
                                    definition- and criteria-type nodes (e.g.,
                                    &lt;criteriaReference&gt;, &lt;observationCriteria&gt;). Additional
                                    guidance is provided for the use of subsets, temporal relationships
                                    and logical groupers. More support and guidance has been provided
                                    for Measure Observations, which are used for Continuous Variable
                                    measures.</li>
                                <li>The <a href="#uvqm_Defn">Definitions</a> segment provides new terms
                                    and definitions (e.g., Numerator Exclusion, Stratification,
                                    Supplemental Data Elements) or updates existing definitions (e.g.,
                                    Denominator Exception, Initial Population).</li>
                                <li>The <a href="#uvqm_Example">Examples</a> segment contains links to
                                    new or updated eMeasure XML files based on the revised HQMF R2
                                    CIM.</li>
                                <li>The <a href="#uvqm_Schema">HQMF Schema</a> segment provides links to
                                    updated eMeasure schema files.</li>
                                <li>A new criteria act class, called Grouper Criteria, allows developers
                                    to express more complex data criteria by performing set operations
                                    of union and intersection, providing more flexibility in expressing
                                    occurrences of events. Further details and examples are discussed in
                                    the chapter on <a href="#uvqm_Model.18">Grouper Criteria</a>. </li>
                                <li>In accordance with public health reporting requirements, a new
                                    measure scoring type, called Cohort Measure, has been added to the
                                    standard. The chapter on <a href="#uvqm_Concepts.3.1.4">Cohort
                                        measure scoring type</a> provides more details. </li>
                                <li>The <a href="#uvqm_Model.12.3.10">temporal relationship act
                                    relationship</a> has been simplified and enhanced, with
                                    additional guidelines provided for developers to specify a range of
                                    timing relationships. </li>
                                <li>Guidelines on timing conventions and uncertainty in real-world time
                                    measurement calculations have been improved, with enhancements to
                                    define custom uncertainty in measures for time comparisons. </li>
                                <li>Measures now have the ability to identify the entity being counted
                                    in a particular measure at the document level or at the specific
                                    population level. This permits HQMF R2 to express non-patient
                                    centric measures, as well as differing populations in the numerator

                        <p>The measure rate for an organization or clinician is based upon the
                            entities' aggregate data and summarizes the performance of the entity
                            over a given time period (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly). The
                            aggregated data are derived from the results of a specific measure
                            algorithm and, if appropriate, the application of specific risk
                            adjustment models.</p>
